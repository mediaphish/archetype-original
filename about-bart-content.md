# About Bart

## Intro

I build leaders worth following.

I didn't set out to be a leader—leadership found me the day my first employee walked into the office and asked me for insurance. I didn't have the revenue, so I used my own income to make it work. That decision wasn't strategy; it was responsibility. Since then I've built teams, defended people when it mattered, led through seasons of growth and collapse, and rebuilt cultures when trust was thin. Those years forged what I now teach: leadership is personal, culture is fragile, and health begins at the top.

I mentor executives and founders, but I'm just as committed to emerging leaders and students. Strength and humility can live in the same sentence. That's the kind of leader I help build.

## From Design to Direction

I started in creative work—design, web, and brand. The work taught me to solve real problems for real people and to translate vision into something tangible. Early opportunities stretched into responsibility. I learned quickly that you don't earn influence by talking about values—you earn it by living them when it costs you.

> Influence starts with responsibility, not position.

## Team, Standards, and Service

As teams formed around the work, I discovered the weight and privilege of leadership. Hiring talented people required more than a budget—it required standards that protected them. I defended team members when it mattered, pushed for clarity when conversations got loud, and chose consistency over the "glory project" chase. Serving people well built momentum that marketing alone could never buy.

### What that looked like (themes, not stories)

- Hiring for character and fit, then teaching the craft and the system.
- Protecting the team from toxic dynamics—even when it risked revenue.
- Building simple rhythms so good people could do great work.

## Community as Culture

At a pivotal moment, I paused billable work to serve my community at scale. That choice didn't polish a brand; it clarified an identity. Leadership isn't a speech—it's a decision you make when no one owes you applause. The lesson stuck: culture is built by what you sacrifice for.

> The fastest way to define culture is to choose service when it costs you.

## The Cost and the Comeback

Later, misalignment and pressure took a toll. I learned how quickly "high performance" becomes "over-performing under constant strain." Selling a company, rebuilding health, and regaining clarity wasn't an abstract principle—it was survival. That season gave me empathy for leaders who carry more than most people will ever see.

Today, my coaching often begins where leaders feel most alone: in the fog between exhaustion and expectation. We quiet the noise, tell the truth, and rebuild from the inside out.

## Back to Purpose — Archetype Original

Archetype Original exists to help leaders build organizations that hold—cultures protected by clear standards, operations aligned to purpose, and growth that doesn't cost your soul. I blend three decades across software, marketing, fitness, and leadership rooms into practical guidance leaders can live with.

I mentor executives and founders; I also invest deeply in emerging leaders and students. The future depends on who they become—so I teach them early that competence without character can't carry weight for long.

## How I Engage (today's work)

### Mentorship

One-to-one guidance for executives, founders, emerging leaders, and students. We build clarity, confidence, and decision discipline without burnout.

### Consulting

Practical help for culture, organizational design, communication rhythms, and go-to-market alignment. Strategy that people can actually live with.

### Speaking & Workshops

Keynotes, classroom talks, and team workshops that translate principles into practice.

### Fractional Leadership

Interim executive coverage to stabilize operations and lead through change—clear lanes, steady cadence, clean handoff.

## What It's Like to Work Together (rules of engagement)

- **Honest by default.** I won't be a "yes-man." We address the real issue, directly.
- **Human first.** I treat people the way I want to be treated—especially under pressure.
- **No dependency.** Success is when you don't need me anymore.
- **Shared accountability.** Accountability is owned most by the person being accountable.
- **Conversation over program.** Real situations. Real plans. Real execution. No subscriptions.

## Where We Start (personal clarity first)

When trust has been broken or confidence shaken, the first clarity is personal. We name what's true about who you are, what you value, and what healthy leadership looks like for you. Then we rebuild structural and directional clarity around that center—roles, decision rights, communication cadence, priorities, and next steps.

### Signals we're on track

- Language becomes clearer; decisions stop looping.
- Teams stop protecting themselves and start protecting the mission.
- Energy returns without bravado.
- You feel strong and calm at the same time.

## Why This Works (research in plain language)

Modern research keeps confirming what experience has already taught me. When people feel heard and supported, their minds unlock. Psychological safety, trust, and empathy aren't soft skills—they're performance multipliers.

### Psychological Safety (Edmondson)

Teams that can tell the truth learn faster and perform better.

### Empathic Listening (Rogers)

Listening to understand reduces anxiety and restores cognitive clarity.

### Neuroscience of Trust (Zak/HBR)

High-trust environments lower stress chemistry and increase productivity and engagement.

### Executive Isolation (Gallup)

Many leaders lack a safe place to process; mentorship restores clarity and better decisions.

> Empathy restores access to reason. Trust unlocks performance.

## What I Hope You Take With You

I want you to reach a point where you don't need me. Not because I lost interest—but because you recovered your center, built systems that fit, and grew leaders who can carry the mission. I'll celebrate your independence every single time.

## Closing

When I'm with a client, I'm 100% theirs.

When I'm not, I'm building this leadership universe—writing, researching, and refining tools you can use. If you're ready to steady the ground under your feet and lead with strength and humility, let's talk.
