# Culture Science Section 7 Parts 6-14 - Cleanup Notes

## Status

- **Part 6**: ✅ Clean - properly named as `ali-diagnostic-part-6.md`
- **Part 7**: ✅ Cleaned - Leadership Profiles content extracted, conversation artifacts removed
- **Parts 8-14**: ⚠️ Need significant cleanup - contain extensive conversation artifacts

## Issues Found

### Parts 8-14 contain:
1. Extensive conversation artifacts ("You said:", "ChatGPT said:", etc.)
2. Mixed content from different parts (e.g., Part 8 file contains Part XIV content)
3. Incomplete canonical content in some files

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Parts 8-14 need manual review to extract canonical content
2. Conversation artifacts should be removed
3. Content should be verified against the original source material
4. Files should be properly named (ali-diagnostic-part-X.md)

## Files Integrated

- `ali-diagnostic-part-6.md` - Clean
- `ali-diagnostic-part-7.md` - Cleaned (Leadership Profiles)

## Files Needing Cleanup

- Parts 8-14 still contain conversation artifacts and need extraction of canonical content
