          <p className="p mt-2 font-semibold text-lg">I build leaders worth following.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">For more than three decades, I’ve helped people and organizations find clarity in the middle of growth, pressure, and change. My career has stretched across software, marketing, fitness, and leadership development—industries that taught me how vision, systems, and people either align or unravel.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">I’ve led through start-ups and shutdowns, through seasons of expansion and rebuilding. Those experiences revealed what I now teach: leadership is personal, culture is fragile, and health always begins at the top.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">Today I mentor executives, founders, emerging leaders, and students who want to grow without losing their center. I’m especially drawn to those still forming their leadership voice—the ones who haven’t yet learned that strength and humility can live in the same sentence.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">Through Archetype Original, I translate hard-won lessons into frameworks leaders can actually live with—systems that protect culture, sharpen focus, and create lasting momentum. I live in the Midwest with my wife and family, still building, still leading, and still believing that healthy leadership changes lives, not just companies.</p>
