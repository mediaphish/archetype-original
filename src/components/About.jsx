            I build leaders worth following.

            For more than three decades, I've led teams through growth, collapse, and full-scale rebuilds across software, marketing, fitness, and leadership development. My career began in design and technology, evolved into executive leadership, and ultimately centered on one question—what kind of leader actually makes people better?
          </p>
          
          <p className="p mt-4">
            That question led me through founding and scaling companies, guiding teams through crisis, and rebuilding culture from the ground up. Over time I distilled what truly works into systems any organization can live with: servant-led standards, consistent clarity, and leadership that protects people while still producing results.

            Today, through Archetype Original, I mentor founders, executives, and teams who want to grow without losing their soul.

            I also created <a className="underline" href="https://scoreboardleadership.com">Scoreboard Leadership</a> as one of several diagnostic contrasts—a reminder of what happens when leadership becomes a game to win instead of a trust to steward.

            I live in the Midwest with my wife and family, still building, still leading, and still believing that the right kind of leader can change everything.
