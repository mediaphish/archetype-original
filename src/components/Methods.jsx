          <p className="p mt-2">Every engagement begins with listening. Every business has its own rhythm, and every leader carries unseen weight. I start by understanding both.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">Much of my work is rooted in servant leadership—the belief that influence begins with responsibility—but it extends far beyond that. I bring more than thirty years of hands-on experience across creative, technical, and operational disciplines to help leaders connect people, process, and purpose.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">The work might look like executive mentorship, business consulting, or fractional leadership. Sometimes it’s rebuilding systems after burnout; sometimes it’s aligning a team for the next stage of growth. Whatever the setting, the goal is the same: clarity, alignment, and sustainable health—for you, your people, and the business that depends on both.</p>
