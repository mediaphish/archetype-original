              The name isn't random. An archetype is the original model—the pattern everything else is measured against. In leadership, it's the difference between being a copy of someone else's playbook and becoming the leader your team actually needs.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[#6B6B6B]">
              I'm not interested in helping you imitate. I'm here to help you become the original—the kind of leader people remember because you made them better.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-[#6B6B6B]">
              That's what this is about: building leaders who don't just manage outcomes, but shape people. Leaders who create cultures where others grow. Leaders who leave a legacy worth remembering.
