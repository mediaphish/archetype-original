          <p className="p mt-2">I believe business and leadership are inseparable.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">Healthy companies grow from healthy people, and healthy people thrive under clear, consistent leadership.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">My philosophy is simple: strategy and stewardship have to meet. Vision means nothing without systems, and systems collapse without character. I work with leaders and businesses to close that gap—to build operations that perform without losing their humanity.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">That means building culture as intentionally as you build profit. It means designing communication, accountability, and decision-making structures that reflect the values you claim to believe. It’s practical, measurable, and lived—because principles only matter if they work under pressure.</p>

          <p className="p mt-4">Archetype Original exists to help leaders and organizations find that balance: growth with purpose, results with integrity.</p>
