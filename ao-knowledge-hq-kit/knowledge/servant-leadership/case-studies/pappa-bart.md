Ryan was one of our engineers — smart, committed, steady. He was working on a project for a client when things suddenly turned volatile. The owner, who had been mostly detached, inserted himself into the situation. He brought along his girlfriend, who also served as the office manager. Neither of them had been involved in the work, but they came in swinging. On a call, they made claims that were flat-out fabrications and laced their accusations with thinly veiled threats.

You just don’t talk to my people that way.

I stopped the call. Cleared everyone else out until it was just me and the owner. I told him plainly that a line had been crossed, and it would not be crossed again. There wasn’t yelling or posturing, but there was no mistaking the seriousness. He heard me. He apologized. And from that moment forward, the project returned to the work it was meant to be.

That moment wasn’t about me proving strength. It was about Ryan knowing he was safe, that someone would step in when things turned unjust. Servant leadership isn’t only about serving the client—it’s about protecting your people when they’re in the right. Dignity has to be shielded. Without it, trust collapses.

A transactional leader might have handled that call differently. They might have absorbed the false accusations, turned on their own employee, or sacrificed dignity in order to keep the client happy. It’s a short-term play: save the account at the cost of the team. But that’s not leadership, that’s fear. Servant leadership takes a different posture. It protects the people doing the work. It creates a climate of justice where trust can grow.

That day, Ryan walked away knowing I had his back. He started calling me "Pappa Bart". And I believe that shaped him just as much as it shaped me. Years later, at the end of my time at MWI, he pulled me aside. He said, “I want to continue to carry the torch for you.” That said everything. He didn’t just want to do good work—he wanted to carry forward the kind of leadership that proved people mattered more than profit.
