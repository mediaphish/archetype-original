I didn’t plan on becoming a CEO.

That might sound strange coming from someone writing a leadership book, but the truth is, this entire journey started with a little curiosity, a lot of uncertainty, and just enough desperation to say yes to things I had no idea how to do.

It all started in the late 1990s when I discovered the Internet. Not in a tech-guru, “I’m going to change the world” kind of way. More like, “Wait, people can make websites from home and get paid for it?” I was a broke college kid and figured I could probably learn enough HTML to fake it until I made it. So that’s exactly what I did.

The first time I got paid to build a website, I thought, “This is it. I’m rich.” It was something like $200, but in 1998, that was gold to me. More importantly, it gave me a taste of something I hadn’t felt in a long time—confidence.

Now, I wasn’t someone who struggled in school. Actually, I was a straight-A student and graduated near the top of my class in 1992. I was pretty smart—math and science made sense to me. I loved art and design, and I could write a solid research paper when I needed to. Looking back, I think I had leadership instincts even then—I just didn’t know that’s what they were. I thought I was just bossy or organized. Turns out, it was something deeper that would surface again later in life.

After college, I landed a job with Precious Moments in Carthage, Missouri. Not because I had a stacked resume or a fancy degree—I didn’t—but because Terri Heckmaster and Ted Easley saw something in me. They took a chance, and that chance changed everything.

As part of the interview process, I was asked to write a press release for an upcoming event. I didn’t even know what a press release was. I stared at the assignment for a while, then decided to do something else entirely. I built a small website—three or four pages—announcing the event. It included event details, a few images, and contact information. No bells and whistles. Just a clean, clear presentation of what people needed to know. It wasn’t what they asked for, but it showed what I could do. That bold little detour got me hired.

I started in the Marketing Department and spent the next four and a half years figuring things out in real time. We didn’t have a huge digital strategy back then—honestly, almost no one did—but I had enough curiosity and drive to learn what we needed as we went. By the time I left, I had helped grow their online sales from $20,000 a year to over $1.2 million. It wasn’t about genius. It was about curiosity, effort, and actually caring about the outcome.

But things took a turn. Eventually, I was reassigned to the IT department. Suddenly, I was troubleshooting hardware, crawling under desks to run wires, and freezing in a server room that felt like a meat locker. It wasn’t what I signed up for—and it wasn’t where I was supposed to be.

That’s when I knew it was time to go.

I didn’t quit in a blaze of glory. I negotiated a termination. Since the new responsibilities weren’t part of my original job description, I qualified for unemployment benefits. That money—modest as it was—became the lifeline that gave my family just enough room to breathe while I figured out what was next.

I tell people it felt like I jumped out of an airplane holding either a parachute or a lunchbox—I wasn’t sure which. But I jumped anyway.

There was no business plan. No investors. No backup strategy. Just a beat-up laptop, a few freelance clients, and a deep determination not to go backward.

Slowly, it grew.

At first, I was just trying to survive. But over time, I realized something bigger was happening. This wasn’t just about websites and logos. It was about building trust. Helping people solve problems. Showing up. And eventually… leading.

I didn’t set out to be a leader, but leadership found me.

And I remember the exact moment it started to take shape.

There was a young guy I knew—just about to get married. He was raw, still learning, but incredibly talented. Honestly, he was already a better designer than I was. I saw something in him and made a decision: I brought him on. Not because the business was booming, but because I believed in building something that could grow beyond just me. I even gave up part of my own income so he could have health insurance. That was my first real and significant leadership decision—the sacrificial kind. The kind where you put someone else’s needs ahead of your own. That moment shifted how I viewed leadership. It wasn’t about power or position—it was about responsibility.

I still made mistakes, of course. I undercharged. I overpromised. I said yes to projects that made no sense just to keep the lights on. I was figuring it out one client at a time, learning how to build a business while also learning how to lead.

But that early decision—to invest in someone else at personal cost—became a kind of blueprint. It showed me what kind of leader I wanted to be. Not the boss barking orders from a corner office, but someone willing to go first. Willing to sacrifice. Willing to bet on people, even before they fully believed in themselves.

And somewhere in that chaos, I started to understand what leadership really is.

It’s not about being the smartest person in the room. It’s about being the most grounded. It’s not about telling people what to do. It’s about listening, lifting, and walking alongside them. It's about seeing people—not just their output. It’s about building something that lasts—not just for your own success, but for the success of others.

This book isn’t here to show off the polished version of that journey. It’s here to walk you through the raw parts, the funny parts, the broken parts—and the breakthroughs. Because I think leadership is less about the mountaintop moments and more about what happens in the climb.

So if you’ve ever felt like you’re figuring it out as you go, welcome. You’re not alone.

This is the story of how I accidentally became a CEO—and how I grew, over time, into someone worth following.
