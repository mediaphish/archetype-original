At Midwestern Interactive, we spent a lot of time talking about how much we cared for our people. That wasn’t unusual—plenty of companies say they care. The difference was whether we could prove it. Talk only goes so far before people start looking around and asking, “Okay, but where’s the action?”

That’s why we created a system we called MWI Cares. It wasn’t just a slogan—it was a structure. The idea was simple: if an employee was struggling, whether with work or something personal, they had a clear pathway to talk to someone they trusted. Not a hotline. Not an HR form that disappeared into a file. A real, human conversation with a teammate who could help them find a way forward.

MWI Cares wasn’t just me. It was a team of people employees could go to, depending on who they felt most comfortable with. But for whatever reason, many ended up in my office. That’s how the crying couch got its reputation. It was a brand-new leather couch, nothing elaborate, but it became a safe place. Over time, team members sat there and poured out stories of stress, failure, broken relationships, or fear about the future. My role wasn’t to fix everything, but to listen, to guide, and to help them take the next right step. That’s leadership in action—not policy or platitude, but presence: sitting with someone in their pain and proving people mattered more than production.

When we announced MWI Cares, the action wasn’t delayed. We put it in place right away, and people began using it. The crying couch was proof that the system was more than words. Our staff learned quickly: when we said we cared, we had receipts. There was a couch, a team, a structure, and a culture that backed it up.

It sounds simple—but that simplicity is what gives it power. Employees didn’t have to wonder if we meant what we said. They experienced it. Every story shared in those conversations reinforced the truth that our culture wasn’t built on fluffy words. It was built on tangible action.

Clinical research backs why this works: dependable support and clear pathways reduce anxiety and increase performance. In plain terms—people do better work when they know where to go and that someone will meet them there.
