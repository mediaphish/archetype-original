I think I realized, sometimes you have to take a risk and bet on yourself.

But for me, that risk didn’t come from a place of confidence. It came from collapse. But sometimes that’s where the most honest leadership begins.

The final stretch of my time at Precious Moments was unraveling at the same time my personal life was collapsing. I wasn’t just going through a divorce—I was living through betrayal. The person I had committed my life to was having an affair with someone I considered a close friend. Not just any friend—a leader in our church small group. Someone I trusted. Someone I prayed with. The fallout wasn’t just relational—it was spiritual. It felt like my entire foundation had been pulled out from under me.

I stayed at work and tried to hold it together. But behind the scenes, I was in survival mode. I was dealing with lawyers, courtrooms, and a custody battle that felt endless. I didn’t know how to make sense of it. I just knew I couldn’t stay in that life anymore.

The divorce became final shortly after I negotiated my termination. The job had shifted far away from what I was hired to do, and I worked out a deal that allowed me to leave with unemployment benefits. That small bit of financial stability became the runway I needed—barely—to try something on my own.

So there I was. Unemployed. Alone. A dad fighting for time with his kids. No plan. No savings. No fallback.

All I had was a belief—just enough to move forward—that maybe I could build something from the rubble.

I started taking on small freelance jobs. Web projects. Design work. Anything that paid. I put my name out there and hoped the next gig would come through. The risk was enormous. The weight was heavy. There was no guaranteed outcome—only the desperate kind of faith that shows up when your back is against the wall.

And then something unexpected happened.

In November of 2003, I met Carie.

She came into my life during the most unstable season I’d ever known. I had nothing to offer her. No job title. No house. No real sense of direction. But somehow, she saw something in me. She didn’t try to fix me—she simply walked beside me. She believed in a future I couldn’t yet see.

We got married in March of 2004. That same year, I officially started the business.

The custody battle continued, and in September of 2004, tragedy struck when Jennifer, my ex-wife, was killed. The legal battle ended, but the emotional journey didn’t. Carie didn’t just embrace my boys—she became Mom, without us even asking. She stepped into their world with full-hearted love, grace, and intention.

And our story didn’t end there.

Within two years, I adopted Oakley—Carie’s daughter—as my own. We didn’t just blend families. We became one. One mom. One dad. Three amazing kids. One roof. One new beginning. God didn’t just mend a broken path—He erased it, and He laid down new ground beneath our feet. Solid ground. Family-shaped ground. It was redemption in its most complete form.

The business was never about chasing success. It was about survival.

It was born in the fire—refined by the need to lead when life gave me no other choice.

It was about giving my family a future.

It was about building something that reflected the second chance I’d been given.

And that’s when I started learning what leadership really meant.

It wasn’t about having all the answers. It wasn’t about climbing a corporate ladder. It was about making intentional choices when nothing felt secure. It was about showing up, even when I didn’t feel qualified. It was about aligning my words with my actions, and letting my values—not my fear—lead the way.

That’s where servant leadership took root. Not because I read about it. But because I lived it. I didn’t want to be the kind of leader who barked from the back—I wanted to be in the trenches. Shoulder to shoulder. Carrying the weight too.

Looking back, I can see it now.

God gave me exactly what I needed—not what I would have asked for, and certainly not what I expected. But what He gave me was better.

He gave me pain that produced clarity.

He gave me people who reminded me I didn’t have to do it alone.

He gave me purpose that outweighed the pressure.

He gave me a path.

And all I had to do was walk it—even when I couldn’t see more than a few steps ahead.

That’s how leadership started for me—not at the summit, but on the shaky path out of ruin.
