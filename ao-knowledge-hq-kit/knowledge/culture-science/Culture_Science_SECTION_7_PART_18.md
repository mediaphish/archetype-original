SECTION 7 — PART XVIII
THE LEADERSHIP COMPETENCY MODEL

ALI measures how leadership is experienced across seven diagnostic dimensions.
But measurement alone does not create growth.

Growth requires competencies—repeatable, observable, trainable leadership behaviors
that shape culture every single day.

Where the ALI dimensions reveal reality, the Leadership Competency Model shapes it.

These five competencies are the foundation of all development inside Culture Science.
They are:

1. Clarity
2. Trust
3. Communication
4. Consistency
5. Safety

Each competency must be:
- defined
- operationalized
- mapped to ALI
- mapped to behaviors
- mapped to micro-practices
- tied to outcomes

This becomes the backbone of all future AO training, development, curriculum,
and Institute programs.


----------------------------------------
1. CLARITY
----------------------------------------

Definition:
Clarity is a leader’s ability to make direction, expectations, priorities, and
standards unmistakably understandable — not only when stated, but throughout execution.

Operationalization:
- one-sentence expectations
- define "done" before work begins
- align priorities publicly
- remove ambiguity
- check understanding without testing
- eliminate competing instructions
- say no to misaligned work

ALI Mapping:
Influences Clarity, Alignment, Communication, Drift, Stability.

Signals:
Strong clarity → faster cycles, lower friction, fewer resets.
Weak clarity → hesitation, rework, conflict, confusion.

Micro-practices:
- One-sentence expectations
- Define Done Before You Begin
- Announce priorities when they shift
- “What feels unclear?”
- Meeting recap

Outcomes:
- faster execution
- reduced conflict
- stable delivery
- leader relief
- team confidence


----------------------------------------
2. TRUST
----------------------------------------

Definition:
Trust is the degree to which a leader’s behavior generates psychological safety,
predictability, honesty, and fairness.

Trust is biological, not preferential.

Operationalization:
- follow through
- truth early
- admit mistakes
- give credit publicly
- protect the team
- remove fear from communication

ALI Mapping:
Influences Trust/Safety, Honesty, Stability, Communication, Drift.

Signals:
Strong trust → candor, early escalation, safety.
Weak trust → silence, fear, late resignations.

Micro-practices:
- Tell the truth early
- Apologize without justification
- Give credit first
- Share the why
- Upward feedback quarterly

Outcomes:
- better decisions
- stronger retention
- more innovation
- fewer hidden issues


----------------------------------------
3. COMMUNICATION
----------------------------------------

Definition:
Communication is not how much a leader says — it is how well information reaches
the right people at the right time in the right way.

Poor communication is distortion.

Operationalization:
- speak plainly
- ask clarifying questions
- remove bottlenecks
- invite dissent
- deliver context, not just tasks

ALI Mapping:
Influences Communication, Alignment, Stability, Drift.

Signals:
Strong communication → autonomy, short meetings, aligned teams.
Weak communication → confusion, repeated questions, assumptions.

Micro-practices:
- One clarifying question before assuming
- Repeat direction without condescension
- Close the loop
- You-first rule
- Write decisions clearly

Outcomes:
- fewer fires
- faster execution
- less leader exhaustion


----------------------------------------
4. CONSISTENCY
----------------------------------------

Definition:
Consistency is the stability of a leader’s actions over time — behavior matching
intention regardless of pressure.

Consistency is credibility over time.

Operationalization:
- same values under pressure
- predictable decision patterns
- honoring commitments
- steady tone
- fair enforcement

ALI Mapping:
Influences Drift, Stability, Trust, Alignment.

Signals:
Strong consistency → credibility, stability, predictability.
Weak consistency → culture instability, distrust, leader drift.

Micro-practices:
- Choose one standard you never bend
- Declare when capacity is low
- Hold commitments
- Identify drift pattern quarterly

Outcomes:
- stability
- trust
- psychological safety
- reduced chaos during crisis


----------------------------------------
5. SAFETY
----------------------------------------

Definition:
Safety is the emotional and interpersonal environment that allows people to speak truth,
ask questions, take risks, and recover from mistakes.

Safety is performance infrastructure.

Operationalization:
- invite dissent
- respond with curiosity
- separate person from behavior
- remove blame
- acknowledge emotion neutrally

ALI Mapping:
Influences Safety, Trust, Communication, Stability.

Signals:
Strong safety → early escalation, innovation, collaborative conflict.
Weak safety → silence, fear, hidden issues, performance collapse.

Micro-practices:
- “What feels risky?”
- Thank people for candor
- Neutral emotion labeling
- Vulnerability without oversharing

Outcomes:
- higher performance
- fewer errors
- resilient teams
- accelerated learning


----------------------------------------
CLOSING
----------------------------------------

These five competencies form the structural backbone of leadership development within
Culture Science. ALI reveals the truth; the competencies transform it.
They are the muscles of Servant Leadership, and strengthening them changes everything.
