Part VII — The Flow of Culture: How Information, Pressure, and Support Move Through an Organization
Every organization has three forms of movement running through it:
	1	Information — what people know
	2	Pressure — what people carry
	3	Support — what people receive
Most cultures fail because these three flows move inconsistently. Tight in one area. Chaotic in another. Blocked somewhere else entirely.
Culture Science treats these flows as structural components—not emotional ones.
1. Information Flow
Information must move:
	•	early
	•	clearly
	•	consistently
	•	in the same direction
	•	with the same meaning
A culture fractures when information moves slower than reality. It stabilizes when information moves faster than confusion.
2. Pressure Flow
Pressure is unavoidable. But how it moves determines whether it stabilizes a team or suffocates it.
Healthy pressure flow:
	•	distributes weight predictably
	•	aligns expectations
	•	reduces emotional volatility
	•	supports execution
	•	prevents overload
Unhealthy pressure flow:
	•	concentrates weight on a few
	•	hides responsibility
	•	destabilizes teams
	•	accelerates drift
Pressure must be governed just as intentionally as workload.
3. Support Flow
Support isn’t “being nice.” It’s the structural reinforcement that keeps people capable under pressure.
Support has to move:
	•	proactively
	•	evenly
	•	predictably
	•	through systems, not personalities
When support flow is consistent, teams stay strong. When it’s inconsistent, teams weaken—even if they never complain.
Why These Flows Matter
Information, pressure, and support are the “circulatory system” of culture. They determine how fast a team can move, how stable it remains, and how much strain it can carry.
This is the part most leaders underestimate:
You can fix policies. You can fix morale. You can fix conflict. But if the flows are broken, the culture will break again.
Culture Science aligns these flows so the organization functions as one environment, not a collection of departments.
