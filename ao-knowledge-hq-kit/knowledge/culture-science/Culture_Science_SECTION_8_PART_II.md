SECTION 8 — Part II  
The Six Forces Every Culture Runs On

Every culture—healthy or dysfunctional—runs on six forces.  
Not values.  
Not slogans.  
Not mission statements.  

Forces.

Most leaders never see them.  
But they feel their effects every day.

These are the six forces that shape every team environment:

1. Direction — where we are going  
2. Alignment — how well we move together  
3. Trust — the stability of every relationship  
4. Responsibility — who carries what, and why  
5. Support — the system that keeps people strong  
6. Pressure — the weight the environment places on people  

These forces are always in motion.  
Always compounding.  
Always influencing behavior — whether leadership is paying attention or not.

Most leadership systems focus on behaviors.  
Culture Science focuses on the forces and conditions that give rise to those behaviors — long before outcomes appear.

If Direction collapses, confusion spreads.  
If Alignment fractures, teams drift into silos.  
If Trust weakens, people pull back.  
If Responsibility is distorted, resentment rises.  
If Support erodes, burnout accelerates.  
If Pressure spikes unchecked, cultures destabilize.

These failures are not moral shortcomings or personality flaws.  
They are environmental breakdowns.

When all six forces are healthy, cultures stabilize.  
When even one is compromised, the others begin to distort.

This is the core premise of Culture Science:  
leadership behavior is shaped by forces leaders often don’t see, but always create.

This is why Culture Science works:  
it removes mystery and replaces it with a coherent, observable system.

The ALI measures how these forces are experienced.  
Culture Science explains what those forces are, how they interact, and why they drift.

Each part of Section 8 will reveal how these forces interact, reinforce, or destabilize the environment —  
not to assign blame,  
but to restore clarity.
