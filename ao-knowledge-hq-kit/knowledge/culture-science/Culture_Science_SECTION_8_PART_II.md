Part II — The Six Forces Every Culture Runs On
Every culture—healthy or dysfunctional—runs on six forces. Not values. Not slogans. Not mission statements.
Forces.
Most leaders never see them. But they feel their effects every day.
These are the six forces that shape every team environment:
	1	Direction — where we are going
	2	Alignment — how well we move together
	3	Trust — the stability of every relationship
	4	Responsibility — who carries what, and why
	5	Support — the system that keeps people strong
	6	Pressure — the weight the environment puts on them
These forces are always in motion. Always compounding. Always influencing behavior—whether the leader is paying attention or not.
Most leadership systems focus on behaviors. Culture Science focuses on the forces that produce those behaviors.
If Direction collapses, confusion spreads. If Alignment fractures, teams drift into silos. If Trust weakens, people pull back. If Responsibility is misplaced, resentment rises. If Support erodes, burnout accelerates. If Pressure spikes unchecked, the culture cracks.
When all six forces are healthy, cultures stabilize. When even one is compromised, the others begin to distort.
This is why Culture Science works: it removes the mystery and replaces it with a measurable ecosystem.
The ALI measures these forces. The Drift System monitors them. The Dashboard visualizes them. The Culture Operating System governs them.
Each part of Section 8 will reveal how these forces interact, reinforce, or destabilize the environment.
