SECTION 7 — PART XXI
The Dashboard Structure (How Leaders See Their Leadership Reality Inside ALI)**
ALI does not exist to produce data. It exists to produce clarity — the kind leaders can act on without confusion, shame, or guesswork.
The dashboard is the way leaders see that clarity.
It is not a scoreboard. Not a heatmap. Not a ranking. Not a “your-team-says-you’re-bad” wall.
The ALI dashboard is a leadership mirror — simple, stable, and human-first.
Everything inside it answers one question:
“What is my leadership creating?”

1. THE SIX-PANEL CORE — THE HEART OF THE DASHBOARD
Every leader has a six-panel structure representing the six dimensions ALI measures:
	1	Clarity
	2	Trust
	3	Communication
	4	Consistency
	5	Safety
	6	Emotional Tone
Each panel includes:
	•	the current quarter’s score
	•	direction of movement compared to previous quarter
	•	the degree of drift (none / mild / moderate / strong)
	•	the top signal driving that shift
	•	recommended micro-practice for this quarter
	•	optional deeper resources or guidance
The purpose of this six-panel core:
Leaders see their reality in one glance — without needing interpretation.

2. THE LEADERSHIP PORTRAIT — “HOW YOU LEAD OVER TIME”
This is the stabilizing backbone of ALI.
Instead of showing “your score this quarter,” the dashboard shows:
	•	your patterns
	•	your strengths
	•	your stability
	•	your drift tendencies
	•	your leadership wake
The Leadership Portrait is made of:
2A. Stability Index
Shows how consistent your leadership has been over the last 4–8 quarters.
2B. Drift Map
Shows where drift tends to emerge first:
	•	clarity drift
	•	communication compression
	•	emotional volatility
	•	consistency wobble
	•	safety decline
Drift is not moral. Drift is predictable. And predictable means preventable.
2C. Strength Anchors
Shows your highest-scoring, most stable dimensions.
Serves as the foundation for remediation steps.
2D. Stress Response Pattern
Every leader has one:
	•	withdraw
	•	over-function
	•	dominate
	•	avoid
	•	accelerate
	•	create urgency
	•	compress communication
ALI maps it clearly without judgment.

3. TEAM EXPERIENCE MAP — THE “HOW THEY EXPERIENCE YOU” PANEL
This is the team-focused counterpart to the Leadership Portrait.
It includes:
	•	the top three strengths the team consistently experiences
	•	the top three friction points the team consistently feels
	•	a clarity score (how well expectations are understood)
	•	a trust score (how safe people feel speaking truth)
	•	a communication score (how clearly information flows)
	•	a consistency score (how predictable leadership is)
	•	a safety score (how safe it is to be honest)
	•	an emotional tone score (how leadership presence impacts the room)
This is not a weapon. This is a translation layer that helps leaders understand the gap between intention and experience.

4. EARLY WARNING PANEL — “WHAT’S STARTING TO SHIFT”
This panel synthesizes the Early Warning System (Part XX).
It includes:
	•	the top drift signal this quarter
	•	severity (mild, moderate, strong)
	•	the likely impact if ignored
	•	the predicted trajectory
	•	micro-practices to stabilize it
	•	a 30-second explanation leaders can use with their team
	•	optional deeper actions leaders can take
This panel is what makes ALI preventative rather than reactive.

5. REMEDIATION PANEL — “WHAT TO DO NEXT”
This panel uses the remediation pathways (Part XIX and XVIII).
It shows:
5A. Immediate Micro-Practices
Small actions leaders can implement this week.
Examples:
	•	“Ask one clarifying question before assuming.”
	•	“Close every meeting with a recap.”
	•	“State expectations in one sentence.”
	•	“Use one ‘you-first’ interaction per day.”
5B. Leadership Pathways
For moderate issues.
Examples:
	•	communication reset
	•	clarity restore
	•	expectations alignment
	•	delegation rhythm improvement
	•	emotional tone regulation
	•	production/leadership load rebalance
5C. Stabilization Routines
Simple weekly practices to maintain stability.
5D. Optional Deep Work
For teams or leaders needing heavier change.
This panel is where ALI becomes action, not theory.

6. COMPANY PROFILE PANEL — “THE SYSTEM YOU’RE LEADING”
ALI maps the organization’s pattern (from Part XIX):
	•	Sensitive System
	•	Overextended System
	•	Bottleneck System
	•	High-Variance System
	•	Fragmented System
	•	Underdeveloped System
Each includes:
	•	how the system behaves
	•	why it behaves that way
	•	how leadership stress affects it
	•	signals that it’s improving
	•	signals that it’s worsening
	•	recommended system-level interventions
Company patterns make sense of the leadership patterns.

7. BENCHMARK PANEL (INTERNAL ONLY)
No cross-company comparison. No external ranking. No “top 10%” nonsense.
Just:
	•	comparison to your own previous quarters
	•	comparison to other leaders inside your company
	•	optional anonymized view of leadership stability trends
This avoids ego-driven comparison and keeps the system human-first.

8. ARCHY INTEGRATION PANEL — “ASK FOR CLARITY”
A small but critical component:
Leaders can open a contextual version of Archy that can explain:
	•	what their score means
	•	why a drift signal matters
	•	how to apply a micro-practice
	•	what a remediation pathway looks like
	•	how to talk to the team about the changes
	•	how to prepare for the next quarter
This creates self-service stability for leaders between surveys.

9. THE CEO/OWNER PANEL — “THE STATE OF THE SYSTEM”
This is visible only to the top leader(s).
It includes:
	•	organization-wide drift trends
	•	department-level stability
	•	rising signals
	•	risk clusters
	•	patterns of improvement
	•	patterns of decline
	•	leadership bench strength
	•	cultural health trajectory
This is the macro version of ALI.

10. ANNUAL MAP PANEL — “THE YEAR IN REVIEW”
At the end of each year, ALI generates:
	•	a 12-month drift graph
	•	a 12-month clarity map
	•	the most stabilized quarter
	•	the most unstable quarter
	•	the most improved dimension
	•	the dimension that needs attention next
	•	an annual leadership portrait
	•	next-year leadership recommendations
	•	notes from the owner/CEO panel
	•	a 60-second summary that can be shared with the team
This becomes the cultural equivalent of an annual report.
