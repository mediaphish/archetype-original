SECTION 7 — PART XIX
Leadership Profiles & Company Profiles (Full Clean Export)**
ALI does not classify people into “types.” Leadership types are fixed; people are not.
ALI identifies patterns — measurable, repeatable leadership behaviors that create predictable cultural effects.
Every leader expresses strengths. Every leader expresses drift. Every leader creates a cultural wake.
ALI quantifies that wake.
Profiles exist for three purposes:
	1	Diagnosis — understanding how leadership is experienced
	2	Visibility — showing leaders what their patterns generate
	3	Direction — mapping a pathway for improvement
Profiles are not labels. Profiles are lenses.

1. PRACTITIONER PROFILES (INDIVIDUAL LEADERS)
1A. The Guardian
Behavioral Signature: Steady, predictable, principled, protective. Drift Signature: Over-functioning; shielding people from necessary tension. Cultural Effect: High trust and safety; sometimes low challenge. Remediation: Delegation, clarity of standards, shift from protection → empowerment.

1B. The Producer-Leader
Behavioral Signature: High output, high ownership, high skill. Drift Signature: Inconsistency, bottlenecking, compressed communication. Cultural Effect: Dependency; slowed execution when leader overloaded. Remediation: Role boundaries, reduced production load, communication scaffolding.

1C. The Aspirer
Behavioral Signature: Vision-driven, relational, optimistic. Drift Signature: Overpromising; weak execution grounding. Cultural Effect: Inspired but confused teams. Remediation: Strengthen clarity, priority resets, measure outcomes.

1D. The Operator
Behavioral Signature: Task-focused, systems-oriented, disciplined. Drift Signature: Rigid communication; low emotional transparency. Cultural Effect: Stable systems; relational distance. Remediation: Communication empathy, emotional labeling, safety practices.

1E. The Stabilizer
Behavioral Signature: Calm, grounding presence. Drift Signature: Avoids tension; stability → stagnation. Cultural Effect: Harmony masking drift. Remediation: Accountability structures; direct-but-kind communication.

1F. The Accelerator
Behavioral Signature: Fast-moving, decisive, opportunistic. Drift Signature: Neglects clarity; urgency cycles. Cultural Effect: Burnout, reactivity, inconsistency. Remediation: Slow loops, reduce commitments, anchor decisions to bandwidth.

2. COMPANY PROFILES (ORGANIZATIONAL PATTERNS)
2A. The Sensitive System
Signature: Truth suppressed due to volatility/retaliation. Outcome: Silence, churn, reputation-protection. Remediation: Safety-first practices, neutral language, third-party facilitation.

2B. The Overextended System
Signature: Too many initiatives; unclear priorities. Outcome: Burnout, reactive culture. Remediation: Clarity overhaul, priority compression, cut non-essential work.

2C. The Bottleneck System
Signature: Few leaders control all information and decisions. Outcome: Slow execution; low development. Remediation: Distributed decisioning, communication scaffolding, reduce leader load.

2D. The High-Variance System
Signature: Standards shift with emotion or pressure. Outcome: Instability, mistrust. Remediation: Consistency protocols, clear norms, non-negotiables.

2E. The Fragmented System
Signature: Departments operate with competing assumptions. Outcome: Misalignment, duplicated effort. Remediation: Alignment reset, cross-functional rhythm, shared context.

2F. The Underdeveloped System
Signature: Strong founder; weak bench; rising leaders unsupported. Outcome: Plateaued growth; execution breaks at scale. Remediation: Leadership pathways, micro-practice development, strengthen clarity & consistency.

3. DRIFT SIGNATURES (EARLY INDICATORS)
	•	clarity scatter (rapid shifting of priorities)
	•	communication compression (context disappears)
	•	emotional volatility
	•	increased correction
	•	reactive decision-making
	•	avoidance of tension
	•	leader isolation
	•	over-functioning
	•	production-first posture
	•	loss of weekly rhythm
	•	shifting expectations without alignment
Drift is predictable. ALI makes it visible.

4. REMEDIATION PATHWAYS
Remediation is not punishment. Remediation is course correction.
ALI ties remediation to:
	•	competency strengthening
	•	micro-practices
	•	communication resets
	•	clarity resets
	•	expectations resets
	•	rhythm stabilization
	•	delegation structure
	•	emotional tone regulation
	•	leadership vs production recalibration
ALI identifies the pattern. The competency model provides the fix. The remediation pathway produces the change.
