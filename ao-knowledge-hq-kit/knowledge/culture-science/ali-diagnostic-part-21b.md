SECTION 7 — PART XXI-B
The Leadership Core Visualization System (How the ALI Orb Tells the Story of a Leader’s Reality)
The ALI Dashboard doesn’t just show numbers. It shows a living picture of leadership.
The Leadership Core is that picture.
Where the six panels and stability summary show the facts, the Leadership Core shows the shape of a leader’s impact.
This is not decoration. It is a visual translation of everything ALI measures — so leaders can see what their leadership is creating, even at a glance.

1. The Leadership Shape — Full From the First Survey
From the very first survey, the Leadership Core renders a full 3D shape, not an empty placeholder.
ALI treats each quarter’s six dimensions as a single leadership vector:
	•	Clarity
	•	Trust
	•	Communication
	•	Consistency
	•	Safety
	•	Emotional Tone
These six values define a Leadership Shape — a multi-faceted silhouette that shows:
	•	where leadership is strong
	•	where it is vulnerable
	•	where it is out of balance
	•	where drift is most likely to begin
Even with one quarter of data, the shape is already meaningful:
	•	a stretched plane toward one dimension reveals over-reliance
	•	a collapsed region reveals fragility
	•	a balanced, rounded structure reveals stability
This makes the first ALI pass immediately usable. Leaders don’t have to wait four quarters to see themselves.

2. The Blob — A Living Field of Leadership Reality
As more people answer ALI surveys, the Leadership Core becomes denser and more alive.
Each respondent is a data point in leadership space. ALI doesn’t show a single dot; it shows a field:
	•	individual points form a point cloud inside the Core
	•	a semi-transparent density field wraps around them
	•	shading and gradients connect the dots into a cohesive, organic blob
The effect is somewhere between:
	•	a Hoberman sphere (structure and expansion)
	•	and a living, breathing field of color
The more people respond:
	•	the more detailed the blob becomes
	•	the more clearly outliers stand out
	•	the more obvious it is where alignment exists
	•	the more honest the portrait of culture becomes
No two companies will have the same shape. Over time, no single company will have the same shape twice.

3. Color as Health — The Gradient From Green to Red
The Leadership Core uses color as a health signal.
Each dimension, each area of the blob, and each cluster of respondents is mapped to a 0–100 scale, then color-graded:
	•	Green – healthy (high scores, stable patterns)
	•	Yellow – watch zone (mid-range scores, minor concerns)
	•	Orange – at risk (low scores, repeated concerns)
	•	Red – major problem (very low scores, strong risk)
The goal is not to shame. The goal is simple: move leadership toward green.
Gradients matter:
	•	when a mostly green area fades into yellow, then orange, then red, leaders can literally see drift appear
	•	in large teams, pockets of red or orange become obvious — small but critical regions where people are not experiencing what leadership intends
	•	in small teams, even a single respondent can bend the field — a visible reminder that every voice counts
A smooth gradient between green and red makes change visible:
	•	when leaders improve, color shifts show it
	•	when leaders drift, color fractures reveal it long before a crisis

4. Drift as Distortion — How Leaders See Emerging Problems
Drift doesn’t just show up as a number. It shows up as a distortion in the Core.
When one dimension begins to slip:
	•	the field in that region darkens toward orange or red
	•	the shape warps or thins along that axis
	•	local density patterns shift — respondents “cluster away” from stability
The more pronounced the drift:
	•	the sharper the distortion
	•	the more intense the color
	•	the more clearly the Leadership Shape leans out of balance
Leaders are not left guessing:
	•	“This is where your leadership is pulling out of alignment.”
	•	“This is where your people are experiencing something different than you intend.”
Drift becomes something you can point at, not just something you feel.

5. Interactions With Meaning — Not Gimmicks
The Leadership Core is interactive, but never for its own sake.
Every interaction must yield clarity, not confusion.
5.1. Rotate to Understand
Leaders can rotate the Core freely:
	•	as the Core rotates, labels for each dimension stay anchored
	•	the highest-scoring area of the shape subtly brightens
	•	the lowest-scoring region subtly darkens
Rotation isn’t a toy. It lets leaders view their leadership reality from every angle — to see how people experience them from different perspectives in the organization.
5.2. Click-to-Focus via Panels
The six panels (Clarity, Trust, Communication, Consistency, Safety, Emotional Tone) sit directly under the Core, plus a seventh Stability/Drift panel.
When a leader clicks any panel:
	•	the Core automatically rotates to face that dimension
	•	the relevant region of the blob is emphasized
	•	local color patterns and density become easier to see
	•	the panel and Core together tell one integrated story
This turns the orb and panels into a single instrument, not separate components.
5.3. Hover for Micro-Insight
When the leader hovers over:
	•	a vertex region,
	•	a color cluster, or
	•	a notable distortion area,
the Core surfaces a short micro-explanation tied to ALI canon, such as:
	•	“Trust is strong and stabilizing this quarter.”
	•	“Clarity is high, but Communication is compressing under stress.”
	•	“Safety is pocketed — some respondents feel safe, others clearly do not.”
Each hover is designed to offer a sentence of truth a leader can act on, not a wall of analytics.

6. Shape Over Time — Leadership as a Story, Not a Snapshot
Quarter by quarter, the Leadership Core doesn’t just add points. It evolves.
For each new survey:
	•	a new Leadership Shape is plotted
	•	the previous shapes fade into the background
	•	leaders can see:
	◦	where they stabilized
	◦	where they improved
	◦	where new drift emerged
	◦	how interventions changed the structure
Rather than a static image, the Core becomes a time-lapse of leadership:
	•	before change
	•	during the work
	•	after the work begins to take root
This is what makes ALI unlike any generic engagement score:
ALI doesn’t just measure experience. It shows how leadership is reforming itself in real time.

7. The Core and the Rest of the Dashboard
The Leadership Core never stands alone.
Underneath it sit the seven panels:
	•	Clarity
	•	Trust
	•	Communication
	•	Consistency
	•	Safety
	•	Emotional Tone
	•	Stability/Drift Summary
The relationship is simple:
	•	the Core shows the whole
	•	the panels unpack the parts
When a leader wants the big picture, they look at the Core. When they want specifics and next steps, they drop to the panels.
ALI’s promise is that leaders will never again have to guess. The Leadership Core is how that promise looks and feels.

Updated Dashboard / Orb Prompt (With Your A–D Decisions Baked In)
Here’s the single prompt you’ll want to copy/save for later.
When you’re ready to actually build the dashboard, drop this into Cursor / ChatGPT and say, “Use this as the master spec; let’s start with X.”

ALI DASHBOARD MASTER SPEC PROMPT (UPDATED)
You are building the ALI Dashboard for Archetype Original. Follow this spec exactly. Do not invent new concepts.

1. CONTEXT
Archetype Original (AO) is a human-first servant leadership consultancy for 10–250 employee companies.
The Archetype Leadership Index (ALI) is AO’s primary diagnostic. ALI measures six leadership dimensions:
	•	Clarity
	•	Trust
	•	Communication
	•	Consistency
	•	Safety
	•	Emotional Tone
ALI runs four 10-question surveys per year, with 3 overlapping questions across quarters.
The Dashboard is the primary interface leaders use to:
	•	see their leadership reality
	•	understand team experience
	•	spot drift early
	•	act on remediation guidance
	•	track change over time
The design must be:
	•	warm
	•	non-judgmental
	•	clear
	•	deeply insightful
	•	aligned with servant leadership
No corporate theater. No cold analytics for analytics’ sake.

2. LAYOUT
Top:
	•	ALI Leadership Core – a 3D interactive “Leadership Shape” (orb/blob) that tells the story of how leadership is experienced.
Below (grid): Seven panels:
	•	Clarity
	•	Trust
	•	Communication
	•	Consistency
	•	Safety
	•	Emotional Tone
	•	Stability/Drift Summary
Each panel shows:
	•	current score (0–100)
	•	change vs. last quarter (up/down/flat)
	•	color (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red)
	•	key insight sentence
	•	1–2 recommended micro-practices
	•	drift signal (if any)
	•	prediction for next quarter (if dimension is focused on)
The Core and the panels must stay in sync.

3. DATA MODEL (JSON)
Use this baseline schema and extend as needed:

{
  "quarter": "2026-Q1",
  "dimensions": {
    "clarity": 0.72,
    "trust": 0.64,
    "communication": 0.81,
    "consistency": 0.69,
    "safety": 0.58,
    "tone": 0.76
  },
  "respondents": [

      "responses": {
        "clarity": 0.8,
        "trust": 0.6,
        "communication": 0.9,
        "consistency": 0.7,
        "safety": 0.55,

  },
  "history": [
    // previous quarters in same shape
  ],
  "correlations": {
    // e.g. "clarity_trust": 0.71
  }
}
You may add fields for:
	•	drift thresholds
	•	early warning events
	•	company profile type
	•	leadership profile type
	•	Archy guidance IDs, etc.

4. LEADERSHIP CORE (3D ORB/BLOB)
Input: 6D vector (clarity, trust, communication, consistency, safety, tone) + respondent data. Output: An interactive Leadership Shape that is meaningful even from the first survey.
Math:
	•	Convert 6D → 3D via:
	◦	X-axis = f(Clarity, Communication)
	◦	Y-axis = f(Trust, Safety)
	◦	Z-axis = f(Consistency, Tone)
	•	Each f is a defined weighted average or PCA-derived component.
	•	Store both the raw 6D and the derived 3D values.
Visualization Rules:
	•	From Survey #1:
	◦	Render a full Leadership Shape (not a single dot).
	◦	Shape should reflect the relative strengths/weaknesses across the six dimensions.
	•	For multiple respondents:
	◦	Render a point cloud inside the Core (each respondent = point).
	◦	Wrap that cloud in a semi-transparent density field so the blob looks full and organic.
	◦	The blob should look like a Hoberman-style structure whose “gaps” are filled with green→red gradients.
Color/Health Rules:
	•	Scale each dimension 0–100.
	•	Use a consistent gradient:
	◦	0–25 → Red (major problem)
	◦	25–50 → Orange (at risk)
	◦	50–75 → Yellow (watch zone)
	◦	75–100 → Green (healthy)
	•	The goal is move toward green across the Core and panels.
	•	Use smooth color transitions so changes in health appear as visible gradient shifts.
Drift Representation:
	•	Drift appears as local distortion and color fracture in the blob:
	◦	regions collapsing or thinning
	◦	patches transitioning to orange/red inside a mostly green field
	•	No gimmicky halos — the primary signal is:
	◦	shape warping
	◦	local color change
	◦	local density change (respondents clustering)

5. INTERACTIVITY (MVP PRIORITY)
Implement at least these three interactions in v1.0:
	1	Free Rotation
	◦	User can rotate the Core in 3D.
	◦	Dimension labels remain clear.
	◦	Highest region subtly brightens; lowest subtly darkens.
	2	Panel → Core Focus
	◦	When a panel is clicked (e.g., Trust), the Core auto-rotates so that dimension’s region faces front.
	◦	Relevant region of the blob is emphasized.
	3	Hover Micro-Insight
	◦	Hovering over a region (vertex/cluster) surfaces:
	▪	the local dimension(s) involved
	▪	a one-sentence interpretation based on ALI canon
	◦	This should feel like “instant coaching,” not an analytics dump.
Other interactions (time playback, respondent toggle, correlations, etc.) can be added later, but these three are non-negotiable in the first usable version.

6. ARCHY INTEGRATION HOOKS
For every panel and for the Core, expose hooks so AO’s AI assistant, Archy, can:
	•	explain what a leader is seeing
	•	answer “why” a drift is happening
	•	point to micro-practices or remediation pathways
	•	help leaders script conversations with their teams about results
	•	surface AO canon content (e.g., Culture Science sections) on demand
You don’t have to implement Archy itself — just design the integration points (event handlers, IDs, metadata tags).

7. OUTPUT EXPECTATION
When given sample ALI data, you should be able to:
	•	compute the Leadership Shape
	•	assign colors correctly
	•	render the Core + seven panels in a coherent layout
	•	demonstrate rotation + panel-focus + hover interaction
	•	generate a structured summary a leader could read (in plain language) that matches what the visuals show.
