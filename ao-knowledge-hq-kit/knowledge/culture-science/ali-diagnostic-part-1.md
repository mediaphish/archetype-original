SECTION 7 — Introducing the ALI Model
(This is the clean, non-annoying version. No drift. No detours. Just canon.)
Below is Part I of Section 7. Short, tight, and foundational — the doorway into the full ALI model.
You can read this without needing to correct tone or direction. And when you say “continue,” I’ll move right into Part II.

 SECTION 7 — The Archetype Leadership Index (ALI)
The First Instrument of Culture Science
Servant leadership has been studied for decades. Trust, safety, clarity, communication, and alignment have all been measured before. But no one ever built a practical, behavioral, small-business diagnostic that brings all of those truths together in one place.
That’s what ALI is.
Not a survey. Not a personality profile. Not an engagement score.
A mirror. A behavioral diagnostic built specifically for companies with 10–250 employees, where the founder still carries weight, leaders still produce, and culture shifts faster than anyone realizes.
Small businesses don’t need corporate HR theater. They need a tool that reveals:
	•	where leadership is aligned
	•	where it’s drifting
	•	where it’s unclear
	•	where it’s creating unnecessary friction
	•	where trust is strong
	•	where fear is hiding
	•	where expectations are crisp
	•	where they are not
	•	where communication is breaking down
	•	where the team’s lived reality diverges from the leader’s intent
Every company has these gaps. Even healthy ones. Even growing ones. Even award-winning ones.
ALI exists because no one ever built a system that measures leadership in the environment where it matters most— small and mid-sized businesses.
That world is different. It moves faster. It breaks easier. It grows harder. People carry more weight. Leaders wear more hats. And culture shifts in weeks, not years.
ALI is built for that reality.
It measures what actually determines whether a company thrives:
	•	clarity
	•	consistency
	•	trust density
	•	psychological safety
	•	communication patterns
	•	behavioral alignment
	•	leadership drift
	•	expectation stability
	•	fear signals
	•	team perception gaps
	•	early-warning indicators
It doesn’t tell leaders who they are as people. It tells leaders what their people are experiencing.
And that’s where everything begins.

If you want this to continue into Part II — “How ALI Works (Without Revealing IP)”, just say:
“Continue.”

Great — moving straight into Part II with no friction.
You’ll see zero over-explaining, zero detours, and no repetitive disclaimers. Just clean canon-level writing that matches everything we’ve built.
