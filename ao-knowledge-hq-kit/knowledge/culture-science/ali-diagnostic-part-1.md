  ALI (Archetype Leadership Index) is the first instrument of Culture Science—a behavioral diagnostic built for small businesses (10-250 employees) that measures leadership through three core lenses: Behavioral Alignment (intention vs. experience), Trust Density (psychological safety and predictability), and Communication & Clarity Patterns (whether messages land). ALI uses multi-angle phrasing, quarterly 10-question cadence, and avoids revealing what's being measured to reduce bias and increase honesty. The core question ALI answers: "Is the leadership you think you're providing the leadership your people actually experience?"

takeaways:
  - ALI is a mirror, not a survey, personality profile, or engagement score
  - ALI measures leadership through behavioral alignment, trust density, and communication/clarity patterns
  - ALI uses multi-angle phrasing (positive, negative, experiential, observational) to reduce bias
  - Quarterly 10-question cadence tracks movement, not moments, with three overlapping questions
  - Questions don't reveal what's being measured to avoid response bias
  - ALI focuses on how leadership is experienced, not who leaders are as people
applications:
  - Small businesses need tools that reveal alignment gaps, drift, clarity issues, and trust fractures
  - ALI measures what actually determines whether a company thrives: clarity, consistency, trust density, psychological safety, communication patterns, behavioral alignment, leadership drift, expectation stability, fear signals, team perception gaps, early-warning indicators
  - The diagnostic reveals where the team's lived reality diverges from the leader's intent

# Section 7 — The ALI Diagnostic (Part 1)

## SECTION 7 — The Archetype Leadership Index (ALI)
### The First Instrument of Culture Science

Servant leadership has been studied for decades. Trust, safety, clarity, communication, and alignment have all been measured before. But no one ever built a practical, behavioral, small-business diagnostic that brings all of those truths together in one place.

That's what ALI is.

Not a survey. Not a personality profile. Not an engagement score.

A **mirror**. A behavioral diagnostic built specifically for companies with 10–250 employees, where the founder still carries weight, leaders still produce, and culture shifts faster than anyone realizes.

Small businesses don't need corporate HR theater. They need a tool that reveals:

- where leadership is aligned
- where it's drifting
- where it's unclear
- where it's creating unnecessary friction
- where trust is strong
- where fear is hiding
- where expectations are crisp
- where they are not
- where communication is breaking down
- where the team's lived reality diverges from the leader's intent

Every company has these gaps. Even healthy ones. Even growing ones. Even award-winning ones.

ALI exists because no one ever built a system that measures leadership in the environment where it matters most— small and mid-sized businesses.

That world is different. It moves faster. It breaks easier. It grows harder. People carry more weight. Leaders wear more hats. And culture shifts in weeks, not years.

ALI is built for that reality.

It measures what actually determines whether a company thrives:

- clarity
- consistency
- trust density
- psychological safety
- communication patterns
- behavioral alignment
- leadership drift
- expectation stability
- fear signals
- team perception gaps
- early-warning indicators

It doesn't tell leaders who they are as people. It tells leaders what their people are experiencing.

And that's where everything begins.

## SECTION 7 — Part II
### How ALI Works (Without Revealing IP)

The architecture behind the instrument

ALI works because it measures leadership the way people actually experience it — in patterns, not personalities; in behaviors, not beliefs; in clarity, not charisma.

Most measurements in business focus on performance, satisfaction, or personality. Those have their place — but none of them expose the **leadership signals** that determine how culture truly functions.

ALI does.

It evaluates leadership through three core lenses:

### 1. Behavioral Alignment
"Does what leaders **intend** match what teams **experience**?"

This includes the signals teams feel every day:

- consistency
- fairness
- emotional steadiness
- follow-through
- clarity of direction
- clarity of expectations
- reliability under pressure
- reactive vs. responsive patterns

Behavior doesn't lie — and people feel drift long before it becomes visible. ALI quantifies those signals.

### 2. Trust Density
"How stable, predictable, and psychologically safe is the environment?"

Trust isn't just emotional — it's behavioral, biological, and environmental. Zak, Edmondson, Gallup, and others proved this long ago.

ALI measures trust the way teams experience it:

- safety to speak honestly
- safety to disagree
- safety under mistakes
- predictable leadership behavior
- fairness across the team
- clarity and transparency
- freedom from retaliation or fear
- confidence in leaders under pressure

This is the core of sustainable performance. And until now, small businesses had no way to measure it.

### 3. Communication & Clarity Patterns
"Do people understand what leaders think they've communicated?"

Most leaders believe they're clear. Most teams experience the opposite.

ALI doesn't measure "communication skill." It measures communication **impact**:

- how well expectations are understood
- whether roles are crisp or blurred
- whether decisions loop or land
- how quickly clarity breaks under stress
- whether the team feels aligned or confused
- whether information flows or gets jammed
- whether leaders are communicating or offloading

Clarity is the backbone of trust, performance, and stability. ALI exposes where it's working — and where it's falling apart.

### Why these three lenses matter together

Any one measurement alone gives a partial picture.

Together, they reveal:

- early symptoms before they become patterns
- patterns before they become problems
- problems before they become crises

This is how you protect culture:
You measure the truth before the consequences arrive.

Small businesses rarely get that chance. ALI gives it to them.

## The ALI Question Architecture
### How we avoid bias, fear, and false positives

ALI questions are designed using a structure that reduces noise and increases honesty:

### 1. Multi-angle phrasing
Each core concept is measured from different angles:

- one positive phrasing
- one negative phrasing
- one experiential phrasing
- one observational phrasing

If all four align → the pattern is strong. If they diverge → something meaningful is happening beneath the surface.

### 2. Quarterly 10-question cadence
To track movement, not moments:

- Four surveys per year
- 10 questions each
- Three questions overlap every quarter
- The rest shift to reveal new signals
- Patterns emerge fast — long before cultural decay does

This prevents burnout, reduces bias, and keeps the tool light for small teams.

### 3. No revealing which questions are "about what"
People answer differently when they know what you're measuring. So ALI removes the temptation.

Questions stand alone. Weights are invisible. Patterns are emergent.

### 4. No personality or preference scoring
ALI isn't about who someone **is** — it's about how leadership is **experienced**. This avoids shame, ego, or defensiveness from leaders. It keeps the focus on behavior and alignment, not identity.

## The Core Outcome of ALI

A simple question with a measurable answer:

"Is the leadership you think you're providing the leadership your people actually experience?"

That's the heart of the model. Everything else points at that one truth.
