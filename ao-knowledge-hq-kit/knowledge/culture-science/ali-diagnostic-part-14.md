SECTION 7 — Part XIV
The Team Experience Map
How ALI Measures Team Reality Across Six Dimensions
If ALI is a mirror for leaders, the Team Experience Map is the landscape behind the mirror.
This tool shows what the team actually experiences on a day-to-day basis — because culture isn’t what leaders intend. Culture is what people live.
Every small and mid-sized business reveals its true health across six measurable dimensions. These dimensions show up consistently in companies of every industry:
	•	construction
	•	healthcare
	•	retail
	•	software
	•	hospitality
	•	churches and nonprofits
	•	education
	•	manufacturing
	•	trades
	•	agencies
	•	professional services
Different industries, same human patterns.
ALI organizes these human patterns into six dimensions.
Let’s walk through them.

 1. Clarity
“Do I understand what’s expected of me?”
This is always the first dimension to wobble — and the first to stabilize when leadership improves.
We measure clarity through questions about:
	•	role expectations
	•	communication accuracy
	•	instruction quality
	•	decision-making transparency
	•	vision comprehension
	•	alignment with direction
When clarity is strong:
	•	teams move fast
	•	miscommunication drops
	•	conflict decreases
	•	stress lowers
	•	performance increases
When clarity is weak:
	•	drift begins
	•	assumptions multiply
	•	emotional friction rises

 2. Trust
“Do I believe leadership means what they say?”
Trust is the core of every leadership model — especially Servant Leadership.
ALI measures trust by examining:
	•	follow-through consistency
	•	fairness
	•	emotional steadiness
	•	transparency
	•	dependability
	•	the leader’s response to mistakes
	•	team confidence in leadership intent
Trust is biological. Gallup. Zak. Edmondson. MIT. Deloitte. They’ve all validated this.
When trust goes down, cortisol goes up. When cortisol goes up, performance collapses.

 3. Communication
“Do I feel informed, heard, and understood?”
Communication is not volume. Communication is connection.
ALI measures:
	•	message consistency
	•	channels used
	•	tone stability
	•	leader accessibility
	•	listening quality
	•	feedback mechanisms
	•	information flow
Communication isn’t just “sending information.” It’s removing ambiguity.
Teams with great communication:
	•	collaborate better
	•	correct faster
	•	innovate more freely
Teams with poor communication stall, even if talented.

 4. Safety
“Is it safe to speak openly without fear?”
Psychological safety is the most researched performance predictor on Earth.
Edmondson called it:
“The single most important factor in team success.”
ALI measures:
	•	emotional safety
	•	conflict safety
	•	idea safety
	•	dissent safety
	•	correction safety
Safety isn’t softness. It’s high-performance infrastructure.
When safety is high:
	•	teams share early
	•	problems surface fast
	•	innovation increases
When safety drops:
	•	silence increases
	•	truth hides
	•	mistakes multiply

 5. Stability
“Does leadership feel predictable?”
Stability is the heartbeat of culture.
We measure:
	•	leadership mood variability
	•	reaction patterns
	•	decision consistency
	•	environmental predictability
	•	clarity of change
	•	steadiness under pressure
Instability creates emotional whiplash.
Stability creates trust.
This dimension distinguishes Servant Leadership from every other model — because Servant Leaders are predictable in both behavior and character.

 6. Alignment
“Are we rowing the same direction?”
Alignment is where strategic clarity meets cultural integrity.
We measure:
	•	mission understanding
	•	team direction
	•	role integration
	•	decision flow
	•	cross-functional cooperation
	•	vision cohesion
Misalignment is subtle but expensive. High alignment is subtle but powerful.
Aligned cultures scale. Misaligned cultures fracture.

 Why These Six Dimensions Matter
Because these six dimensions are:
	•	universal
	•	measurable
	•	predictive
	•	actionable
	•	stable across industries
	•	consistent across team sizes
	•	validated by research
	•	proven by lived leadership experience
And more importantly:
**They give small and mid-sized businesses something they’ve never had:
a complete, scientific picture of their own leadership reality.**
