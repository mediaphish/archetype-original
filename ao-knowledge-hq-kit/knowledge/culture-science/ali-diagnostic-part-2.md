  The ALI Scoring Model produces three layers of insight: Alignment Score (gap between intention and experience), Stability Score (predictability and safety), and Clarity Score (understanding of direction, priorities, roles, expectations). These three scores work together to create a triangulated pattern. ALI also produces a Trajectory Score (momentum over time) and a Behavioral Map (non-numeric insights about trusted/questioned behaviors, consistency, drift, bottlenecks, and accelerators). The Behavioral Map is where coaching, mentoring, and training begin.
source:
  kind: internal
takeaways:
  - ALI produces three core scores: Alignment, Stability, and Clarity
  - Alignment Score compares leadership intention to team experience—reveals gaps, drift, blind spots, disconnects, strengths, early-warning signals
  - Stability Score measures predictability, safety, fairness, psychological openness, emotional regulation—surfaces hidden fear, tension, volatility, trust fractures
  - Clarity Score measures expectation alignment, role clarity, communication effectiveness, decision-making flow, information accessibility, direction understanding, priority consistency
  - The three scores work together to create triangulated patterns (e.g., High Alignment + Low Stability = team trusts leader but environment feels unpredictable)
  - Trajectory Score shows momentum over time—whether culture is improving, alignment tightening, trust building, drift slowing/accelerating
  - Behavioral Map identifies what behaviors teams trust/question, where leaders are consistent/drift, where behaviors become bottlenecks/accelerators
applications:
  - Leaders need triangulated patterns, not single metrics, to understand where to focus and how to improve
  - Trajectory Score provides feedback loop that protects culture before it breaks—small businesses need momentum tracking, not snapshots
  - Behavioral Map is where transformation happens—ALI shines a light, the Institute builds the path forward

# Section 7 — The ALI Diagnostic (Part 2)

## SECTION 7 — Part III
### The ALI Scoring Model (High-Level, Without Exposing IP)

How the instrument turns human experience into measurable clarity

At its core, the ALI scoring model answers a single essential question:

"How closely does the leadership your team experiences match the leadership you intend to provide?"

Everything flows from that.

But ALI never reduces leadership to one number. It produces **three layers of insight** that work together:

### 1. The Alignment Score
The gap between intention and experience

This is the heart of ALI.

It compares leadership intention (how leaders think they're showing up) to lived experience (how the team actually feels it).

It reveals:

- alignment
- drift
- blind spots
- disconnects
- strengths
- early-warning signals

A high alignment score doesn't mean "perfect leadership." It means the leader is **clear, consistent, and predictable** in ways the team trusts.

A low score doesn't mean "bad leadership." It means there is **a gap** — and gaps can be fixed.

This is the mirror leaders have never had.

### 2. The Stability Score
How predictable, steady, and safe the culture feels

Teams perform best when the environment feels:

- steady
- safe
- predictable
- fair
- psychologically open
- emotionally regulated
- structurally sound

Stability is not the absence of pressure — it's **the presence of predictability under pressure**.

The Stability Score surfaces:

- hidden fear
- unspoken tension
- emotional volatility
- inconsistent leadership signals
- role confusion
- uneven expectations
- trust fractures
- communication bottlenecks

Stability is the #1 predictor of long-term performance in small businesses. ALI measures the lived reality behind it.

### 3. The Clarity Score
How well the team understands direction, priorities, roles, and expectations

Clarity is oxygen.

Teams don't need perfection — they need to understand **what matters, why it matters, and how success is defined**.

The Clarity Score measures:

- expectation alignment
- role clarity
- communication effectiveness
- decision-making flow
- information accessibility
- direction understanding
- priority consistency

Teams don't burn out from workload. They burn out from **unclear, shifting, or unspoken expectations**.

Clarity prevents that.

## How the Three Scores Work Together

Most leadership tools give one metric. ALI gives a **triangulated pattern** — clear, actionable, and behavior-based.

For example:

- High Alignment + Low Stability = The team trusts the leader, but the environment feels unpredictable.
- High Stability + Low Clarity = The team feels safe, but they don't know what the leader actually wants.
- High Clarity + Low Alignment = People understand the direction, but don't trust the behavior delivering it.

ALI doesn't just tell leaders "how they're doing." It tells them **where** to focus, **how** to improve, and **what** the team needs most right now.

This is why it works. It diagnoses the **pattern, not the symptoms**.

---

## 4. The Trajectory Score (the secret weapon)
### The most important metric ALI produces

Most diagnostics give a snapshot.

ALI gives **momentum**.

The Trajectory Score tells leaders:

- whether culture is improving
- whether alignment is tightening
- whether trust is building
- whether clarity is strengthening
- whether drift is slowing or accelerating
- whether instability is rising
- whether fear is decreasing
- whether expectations are landing

Trajectory is driven by:

- quarterly patterns
- the overlapping questions
- multi-angle phrasing
- trend detection
- signal consistency

Small businesses don't need a one-time assessment. They need **a feedback loop that protects culture before it breaks**.

Trajectory is the loop.

## 5. The Behavioral Map
### The non-numeric insight ALI generates

Alongside the scores, ALI produces a **Behavioral Map**:

- What behaviors the team trusts
- What behaviors the team questions
- Where leaders are consistent
- Where leaders drift
- Where leadership behaviors become bottlenecks
- Where leadership behaviors become accelerators

This is where the Institute lives. This is where coaching, mentoring, and training begin. This is where transformation happens.

ALI shines a light. The Institute builds the path forward.

## SECTION 7 — Part IV
### The ALI Categories
### The Seven Patterns Every Leader Must Master

Every insight ALI uncovers — every drift signal, trust fracture, clarity gap, or stability issue — fits into one of seven leadership patterns.

These seven patterns form the **Leadership Operating Structure** that Culture Science is built on.

They are not personality traits. They are not "strengths" or "weaknesses." They are **behavioral patterns** that either build culture or erode it.

Most instruments stop at awareness. ALI goes further: it organizes all leadership behavior into a framework leaders can understand, improve, and repeat.

Here are the seven patterns.

### 1. Clarity
"Do people understand what matters most?"

Every team runs on clarity.

Not noise. Not charisma. Not motivation.

Clarity.

ALI examines whether leaders:

- define expectations
- communicate priorities
- explain decisions
- give direction that actually lands
- maintain clarity under pressure
- correct drift quickly
- protect people from ambiguity

Clarity is the leader's first responsibility. Everything else breaks without it.

### 2. Consistency
"Do leaders show up the same way every time?"

People trust predictable leadership.

Teams perform better when leaders:

- behave consistently
- enforce standards consistently
- respond consistently
- regulate their emotions consistently
- follow through consistently

Instability doesn't come from pressure — it comes from **inconsistent behavior** under pressure.

Consistency determines stability.

### 3. Trust
"Is this a place where people can speak honestly?"

Trust is not a feeling. It is the result of repeated, reliable, predictable behavior.

ALI evaluates whether the team experiences:

- psychological safety
- fairness
- openness
- honesty
- transparency
- stable reactions
- space for disagreement

Trust is the currency of leadership. Without it, "alignment" is just compliance.

### 4. Communication
"Does information flow, or does it get stuck?"

Communication isn't about talking — it's about whether the **message lands**.

ALI surfaces:

- decision bottlenecks
- message distortion
- looping conversations
- unclear expectations
- fear-based silence
- information hoarding
- "leadership by assumption"

Communication reveals how leadership actually functions day to day.

### 5. Alignment
"Do team behavior and leader intention match?"

This is where the hidden fractures live.

ALI identifies whether:

- leaders and teams interpret values the same way
- behavior matches cultural expectations
- teams understand what "good" looks like
- people are rowing in the same direction
- the organization is drifting

Alignment is what turns culture into action.

### 6. Stability
"Does the environment feel safe, steady, and predictable?"

This category reflects the emotional backbone of the organization.

ALI measures:

- emotional steadiness
- psychological structure
- pressure management
- conflict handling
- role stability
- expectation stability

Teams cannot operate in chaos. Stability creates the conditions for performance.

### 7. Leadership Drift
"Are small behavior changes slowly creating big cultural consequences?"

Drift is the silent killer of small businesses.

It shows up when leaders:

- stop communicating clearly
- avoid conflict
- allow ambiguity to grow
- become reactive
- change standards subtly
- reduce accountability
- overcorrect under pressure
- slip into inconsistent patterns

Drift is rarely intentional — but it is always measurable.

ALI reveals drift before it becomes damage.

## Why These Seven Matter

This framework gives every leader a way to:

- understand themselves
- understand their team
- understand how people experience them
- identify what's healthy
- identify what's drifting
- identify what's destructive

ALI organizes complexity into clarity. The Institute turns that clarity into capability.

This is how small businesses transform for good.
