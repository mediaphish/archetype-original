summary: >
  Part 18 strengthens ALI’s alignment-diagnostic system by showing how misalignment forms through
  subtle divergences in direction, interpretation, and execution. It explains how ALI captures
  these fractures early—before they escalate into operational confusion, slowed execution, or
  competing versions of the plan inside the organization.
source:
  kind: internal
takeaways:
  - Misalignment begins as small interpretive gaps, not open conflict.
  - ALI identifies alignment fractures by measuring inconsistent movement across forces.
  - Divergent interpretations of direction always signal deeper structural confusion.
applications:
  - Use ALI alignment signals to uncover early directional drift.
  - Evaluate where teams are executing different versions of the same plan.
  - Re-establish clarity through shared language, reinforced context, and stable decision paths.

The ALI Dashboard doesnt just show numbers.It shows a living picture of leadership.
The Leadership Core is that picture.
Where the six panels and stability summary show the facts,the Leadership Core shows the shape of a leaders impact.
This is not decoration.It is a visual translation of everything ALI measures so leaders can see what their leadership is creating, even at a glance.

1. The Leadership Shape  Full From the First Survey
From the very first survey, the Leadership Core renders a full 3D shape, not an empty placeholder.
ALI treats each quarters six dimensions as a single leadership vector:
		Clarity
		Trust
		Communication
		Consistency
		Safety
		Emotional Tone
These six values define a Leadership Shape a multi-faceted silhouette that shows:
		where leadership is strong
		where it is vulnerable
		where it is out of balance
		where drift is most likely to begin
Even with one quarter of data, the shape is already meaningful:
		a stretched plane toward one dimension reveals over-reliance
		a collapsed region reveals fragility
		a balanced, rounded structure reveals stability
This makes the first ALI pass immediately usable.Leaders dont have to wait four quarters to see themselves.

2. The Blob  A Living Field of Leadership Reality
As more people answer ALI surveys, the Leadership Core becomes denser and more alive.
Each respondent is a data point in leadership space.ALI doesnt show a single dot; it shows a field:
		individual points form a point cloud inside the Core
		a semi-transparent density field wraps around them
		shading and gradients connect the dots into a cohesive, organic blob
The effect is somewhere between:
		a Hoberman sphere (structure and expansion)
		and a living, breathing field of color
The more people respond:
		the more detailed the blob becomes
		the more clearly outliers stand out
		the more obvious it is where alignment exists
		the more honest the portrait of culture becomes
No two companies will have the same shape.Over time, no single company will have the same shape twice.

3. Color as Health  The Gradient From Green to Red
The Leadership Core uses color as a health signal.
Each dimension, each area of the blob, and each cluster of respondents is mapped to a 0100 scale, then color-graded:
		Green  healthy (high scores, stable patterns)
		Yellow  watch zone (mid-range scores, minor concerns)
		Orange  at risk (low scores, repeated concerns)
		Red  major problem (very low scores, strong risk)
The goal is not to shame.The goal is simple: move leadership toward green.
Gradients matter:
		when a mostly green area fades into yellow, then orange, then red, leaders can literally see drift appear
		in large teams, pockets of red or orange become obvious  small but critical regions where people are not experiencing what leadership intends
		in small teams, even a single respondent can bend the field  a visible reminder that every voice counts
A smooth gradient between green and red makes change visible:
		when leaders improve, color shifts show it
		when leaders drift, color fractures reveal it long before a crisis

4. Drift as Distortion  How Leaders See Emerging Problems
Drift doesnt just show up as a number.It shows up as a distortion in the Core.
When one dimension begins to slip:
		the field in that region darkens toward orange or red
		the shape warps or thins along that axis
		local density patterns shift  respondents cluster away from stability
The more pronounced the drift:
		the sharper the distortion
		the more intense the color
		the more clearly the Leadership Shape leans out of balance
Leaders are not left guessing:
		This is where your leadership is pulling out of alignment.
		This is where your people are experiencing something different than you intend.
Drift becomes something you can point at, not just something you feel.

5. Interactions With Meaning  Not Gimmicks
The Leadership Core is interactive, but never for its own sake.
Every interaction must yield clarity, not confusion.
5.1. Rotate to Understand
Leaders can rotate the Core freely:
		as the Core rotates, labels for each dimension stay anchored
		the highest-scoring area of the shape subtly brightens
		the lowest-scoring region subtly darkens
Rotation isnt a toy.It lets leaders view their leadership reality from every angle to see how people experience them from different perspectives in the organization.
5.2. Click-to-Focus via Panels
The six panels (Clarity, Trust, Communication, Consistency, Safety, Emotional Tone) sit directly under the Core, plus a seventh Stability/Drift panel.
When a leader clicks any panel:
		the Core automatically rotates to face that dimension
		the relevant region of the blob is emphasized
		local color patterns and density become easier to see
		the panel and Core together tell one integrated story
This turns the orb and panels into a single instrument, not separate components.
5.3. Hover for Micro-Insight
When the leader hovers over:
		a vertex region,
		a color cluster, or
		a notable distortion area,
the Core surfaces a short micro-explanation tied to ALI canon, such as:
		Trust is strong and stabilizing this quarter.
		Clarity is high, but Communication is compressing under stress.
		Safety is pocketed  some respondents feel safe, others clearly do not.
Each hover is designed to offer a sentence of truth a leader can act on, not a wall of analytics.

6. Shape Over Time  Leadership as a Story, Not a Snapshot
Quarter by quarter, the Leadership Core doesnt just add points.It evolves.
For each new survey:
		a new Leadership Shape is plotted
		the previous shapes fade into the background
		leaders can see:
		where they stabilized
		where they improved
		where new drift emerged
		how interventions changed the structure
Rather than a static image, the Core becomes a time-lapse of leadership:
		before change
		during the work
		after the work begins to take root
This is what makes ALI unlike any generic engagement score:
ALI doesnt just measure experience.It shows how leadership is reforming itself in real time.

7. The Core and the Rest of the Dashboard
The Leadership Core never stands alone.
Underneath it sit the seven panels:
		Clarity
		Trust
		Communication
		Consistency
		Safety
		Emotional Tone
		Stability/Drift Summary
The relationship is simple:
		the Core shows the whole
		the panels unpack the parts
When a leader wants the big picture, they look at the Core.When they want specifics and next steps, they drop to the panels.
ALIs promise is that leaders will never again have to guess.The Leadership Core is how that promise looks and feels.

2 Updated Dashboard / Orb Prompt (With Your AD Decisions Baked In)
Heres the single prompt youll want to copy/save for later.
When youre ready to actually build the dashboard, drop this into Cursor / ChatGPT and say, Use this as the master spec; lets start with X.

 ALI DASHBOARD MASTER SPEC PROMPT (UPDATED)
You are building the ALI Dashboard for Archetype Original.Follow this spec exactly. Do not invent new concepts.

1. CONTEXT
Archetype Original (AO) is a human-first servant leadership consultancy for 10250 employee companies.
The Archetype Leadership Index (ALI) is AOs primary diagnostic.ALI measures six leadership dimensions:
		Clarity
		Trust
		Communication
		Consistency
		Safety
		Emotional Tone
ALI runs four 10-question surveys per year, with 3 overlapping questions across quarters.
The Dashboard is the primary interface leaders use to:
		see their leadership reality
		understand team experience
		spot drift early
		act on remediation guidance
		track change over time
The design must be:
		warm
		non-judgmental
		clear
		deeply insightful
		aligned with servant leadership
No corporate theater. No cold analytics for analytics sake.

2. LAYOUT
Top:
		ALI Leadership Core  a 3D interactive Leadership Shape (orb/blob) that tells the story of how leadership is experienced.
Below (grid):Seven panels:
		Clarity
		Trust
		Communication
		Consistency
		Safety
		Emotional Tone
		Stability/Drift Summary
Each panel shows:
		current score (0100)
		change vs. last quarter (up/down/flat)
		color (Green/Yellow/Orange/Red)
		key insight sentence
		12 recommended micro-practices
		drift signal (if any)
		prediction for next quarter (if dimension is focused on)
The Core and the panels must stay in sync.
