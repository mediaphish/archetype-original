SECTION 7 — Part III
The ALI Scoring Model (High-Level, Without Exposing IP)
How the instrument turns human experience into measurable clarity
At its core, the ALI scoring model answers a single essential question:
“How closely does the leadership your team experiences match the leadership you intend to provide?”
Everything flows from that.
But ALI never reduces leadership to one number. It produces three layers of insight that work together:

 1. The Alignment Score
The gap between intention and experience
This is the heart of ALI.
It compares leadership intention (how leaders think they’re showing up) to lived experience (how the team actually feels it).
It reveals:
	•	alignment
	•	drift
	•	blind spots
	•	disconnects
	•	strengths
	•	early-warning signals
A high alignment score doesn’t mean “perfect leadership.” It means the leader is clear, consistent, and predictable in ways the team trusts.
A low score doesn’t mean “bad leadership.” It means there is a gap — and gaps can be fixed.
This is the mirror leaders have never had.

 2. The Stability Score
How predictable, steady, and safe the culture feels
Teams perform best when the environment feels:
	•	steady
	•	safe
	•	predictable
	•	fair
	•	psychologically open
	•	emotionally regulated
	•	structurally sound
Stability is not the absence of pressure — it’s the presence of predictability under pressure.
The Stability Score surfaces:
	•	hidden fear
	•	unspoken tension
	•	emotional volatility
	•	inconsistent leadership signals
	•	role confusion
	•	uneven expectations
	•	trust fractures
	•	communication bottlenecks
Stability is the #1 predictor of long-term performance in small businesses. ALI measures the lived reality behind it.

 3. The Clarity Score
How well the team understands direction, priorities, roles, and expectations
Clarity is oxygen.
Teams don’t need perfection — they need to understand what matters, why it matters, and how success is defined.
The Clarity Score measures:
	•	expectation alignment
	•	role clarity
	•	communication effectiveness
	•	decision-making flow
	•	information accessibility
	•	direction understanding
	•	priority consistency
Teams don’t burn out from workload. They burn out from unclear, shifting, or unspoken expectations.
Clarity prevents that.

 How the Three Scores Work Together
Most leadership tools give one metric. ALI gives a triangulated pattern — clear, actionable, and behavior-based.
For example:
	•	High Alignment + Low Stability = The team trusts the leader, but the environment feels unpredictable.
	•	High Stability + Low Clarity = The team feels safe, but they don’t know what the leader actually wants.
	•	High Clarity + Low Alignment = People understand the direction, but don’t trust the behavior delivering it.
ALI doesn’t just tell leaders “how they’re doing.” It tells them where to focus, how to improve, and what the team needs most right now.
This is why it works. It diagnoses the pattern, not the symptoms.

 4. The Trajectory Score (the secret weapon)
The most important metric ALI produces
Most diagnostics give a snapshot.
ALI gives momentum.
The Trajectory Score tells leaders:
	•	whether culture is improving
	•	whether alignment is tightening
	•	whether trust is building
	•	whether clarity is strengthening
	•	whether drift is slowing or accelerating
	•	whether instability is rising
	•	whether fear is decreasing
	•	whether expectations are landing
Trajectory is driven by:
	•	quarterly patterns
	•	the overlapping questions
	•	multi-angle phrasing
	•	trend detection
	•	signal consistency
Small businesses don’t need a one-time assessment. They need a feedback loop that protects culture before it breaks.
Trajectory is the loop.

 5. The Behavioral Map
The non-numeric insight ALI generates
Alongside the scores, ALI produces a Behavioral Map:
	•	What behaviors the team trusts
	•	What behaviors the team questions
	•	Where leaders are consistent
	•	Where leaders drift
	•	Where leadership behaviors become bottlenecks
	•	Where leadership behaviors become accelerators
This is where the Institute lives. This is where coaching, mentoring, and training begin. This is where transformation happens.
ALI shines a light. The Institute builds the path forward.
