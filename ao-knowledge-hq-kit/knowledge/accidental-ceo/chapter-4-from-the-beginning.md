When I look back at the early years, I can see a clear dividing line. For a long time, I was just doing the work — building websites from a home office, keeping clients happy, and trying to survive. But the moment I began to gather a team around me, the weight shifted. I wasn’t only responsible for outcomes anymore. I was responsible for people.

From the beginning, my goal wasn’t to build a company for its own sake. Plenty of people start businesses with growth or profit as the target. That was never enough for me. My goal was to live out servant leadership through the culture we created. Accountability and service weren’t strategies I added later — they were in my DNA, and they shaped everything that followed.

I knew a company’s culture doesn’t appear by accident. It forms in the early decisions, in the way leaders respond to pressure, and in the values that get reinforced when things go wrong. These were the moments when my posture as a servant leader either took root or withered. Looking back now, I can see the fingerprints of those decisions everywhere.

This chapter is about those first defining stories. They weren’t glamorous. They didn’t make headlines. But they show what was at the core of the company from the very beginning: service, protection, and accountability.

When the tornado hit Joplin in May of 2011, our community was put in a blender. It wasn’t just destruction — it was disorientation. People didn’t know where to go, what resources existed, or how to connect their needs to the flood of help pouring in.

The call came from a friend, the director of a local non-profit. Their mission was already to serve the community, and when the tornado hit, their focus shifted overnight. They asked if I could drop everything and build a system to connect needs to resources. I said yes, and my team followed my lead.

For me, that decision wasn’t some bold, heroic moment. It was simple: this is what we do when our community needs help. Servant leadership doesn’t posture. It turns effort outward.

The pace inside our office those three days was electric. We felt the weight of the darkness pressing in from outside, but we stayed locked on the goal. High energy, high pressure, no slack. That’s normal in software — but here, the stakes were human. If we shipped this system, people might actually get help faster. If we failed, the cracks in the relief effort would swallow real families.

For 72 hours we ran 24x7. We stretched our pace, our skills, and our endurance further than ever before. The platform launched, and I had to step outside just to catch my breath. We had accomplished the mission. People had a better chance at getting what they needed in the most dire situation any of us had ever known.

I wasn’t proud of myself. I was proud of my team. Not one of them had lost a home. Not one of them had a personal stake in the recovery. They gave everything they had because that’s what servant leaders do: they give until they’re empty. And I did the same. Every last ounce.

On Monday, I led us back into client work. No celebration. No victory lap. That’s what we do.

Looking back, I see now what Robert Greenleaf meant by stewardship. A servant leader isn’t chasing recognition — they take responsibility for the people and communities around them, even when no one’s asking. Larry Spears later described this posture as “community building,” one of the core pillars of servant leadership. That’s what this was. We didn’t just build a website. We built a lifeline.

The cost was real. Three days of exhaustion. A year of follow-up improvements and support while balancing our workload. Potentially strained client timelines. But the payoff was beyond measure: a community that had a fighting chance and a team that learned, firsthand, what it meant to pour out everything in service of others.

Servant leadership shows itself in the small cracks most people overlook. Big institutions stepped in after the tornado, but their help took time. Insurance checks didn’t show up overnight, and families were left waiting. In the meantime, real needs went unmet — a window to keep the rain out, a set of tires so someone could get to work.

That gap became the heart of Restore Joplin. A simple logo — a heart with a bandage — gave people a way to rally. We raised $250,000, and every dollar went to those in-between needs. Nothing glamorous. Nothing headline-worthy. Just the kind of ordinary faithfulness that keeps people moving one step forward.

This is the part of servant leadership that rarely gets attention. It isn’t about standing out or being called a hero. It’s about elevating others quietly, often anonymously, and meeting them right where they are. The power isn’t in the size of the gift but in the posture behind it: what can I do, with what I have, to lift someone else?

That same posture played out inside the company, too. Servant leadership wasn’t just for disaster response. It was how I chose to lead every day.

Pappa Bart

Ryan was one of our engineers — smart, committed, steady. He was working on a project for a client when things suddenly turned volatile. The owner, who had been mostly detached, inserted himself into the situation. He brought along his girlfriend, who also served as the office manager. Neither of them had been involved in the work, but they came in swinging. On a call, they made claims that were flat-out fabrications and laced their accusations with thinly veiled threats.

You just don’t talk to my people that way.

I stopped the call. Cleared everyone else out until it was just me and the owner. I told him plainly that a line had been crossed, and it would not be crossed again. There wasn’t yelling or posturing, but there was no mistaking the seriousness. He heard me. He apologized. And from that moment forward, the project returned to the work it was meant to be.

That moment wasn’t about me proving strength. It was about Ryan knowing he was safe, that someone would step in when things turned unjust. Servant leadership isn’t only about serving the client—it’s about protecting your people when they’re in the right. Dignity has to be shielded. Without it, trust collapses.

A transactional leader might have handled that call differently. They might have absorbed the false accusations, turned on their own employee, or sacrificed dignity in order to keep the client happy. It’s a short-term play: save the account at the cost of the team. But that’s not leadership, that’s fear. Servant leadership takes a different posture. It protects the people doing the work. It creates a climate of justice where trust can grow.

That day, Ryan walked away knowing I had his back. He started calling me "Pappa Bart". And I believe that shaped him just as much as it shaped me. Years later, at the end of my time at MWI, he pulled me aside. He said, “I want to continue to carry the torch for you.” That said everything. He didn’t just want to do good work—he wanted to carry forward the kind of leadership he had experienced.

Accountability – A Two Way Street

Kevin was a client you couldn’t forget. He was six-foot-four, with a cowboy hat and a booming voice that could fill the building. When he came to see us, you knew it. He believed in us, but he expected results, and he didn’t shy away from saying so.

One project started to slip, and the mistakes were on Mike, one of our engineers. He was talented but young, and at that point his ego was outpacing his execution. He had dropped several balls, and this time Kevin noticed.

I wasn’t in the building that day, but I didn’t need to be. Kevin’s voice carried, and the story of that meeting made the rounds quickly. He called out the failure directly, laying it plain with the kind of authority only a man like him could bring. Mike had no excuse, and I didn’t give him one. He faced Kevin himself, absorbed the weight of the accountability, and promised to fix it.

At the time, the truth was Mike wasn’t open to being led. Pride and ego were getting in his way, and it created separation between him and the culture I was trying to build. Sometimes servant leadership means protecting, like I did with Ryan. Other times it means stepping back and letting someone face the weight of their own decisions. Shielding Mike would have spared him in the moment, but it wouldn’t have helped him grow.

As soon as I heard what had taken place, I called Kevin myself. I didn’t try to downplay it or make excuses. I thanked him for speaking up. We deserved to hear everything he told us. He was right to expect better, and I wanted him to know his voice mattered. That honesty only strengthened the relationship. Kevin didn’t lose respect for us because of the mistake—he gained more because we owned it.

Years later, Mike approached me and apologized. It had taken time, but he eventually recognized the arrogance and damage of those years. He did his best to reconcile. That moment didn’t erase the cost of his choices, but it did remind me that accountability, paired with truth, can still plant seeds that bear fruit—sometimes much later than we expect.

The culture I was shaping wasn’t defined by one big moment. It was formed by dozens of decisions like these. Protecting when it was right. Exposing when it was needed. Stepping into the gaps, whether for a community shattered by disaster or an employee who needed the weight of accountability.

That is the essence of servant leadership. Not theory. Not slogans. Just a steady posture of service, justice, truth, and care — lived out in real moments with real people.
