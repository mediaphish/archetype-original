Chapter 10 — The Rise of Archetype

I didn’t get relief; I got room to breathe. Not in Joplin—in Carthage. The sale closed one story there; the work changed shape here. No victory lap. No speech. Just a little space back.

The name on the wall was next. Midwestern Built had carried us for years, but it no longer told the truth about the gym—or about me. We didn’t try to rescue it. We laid it down and set a standard that matched how we were actually living. For a long stretch my work had been wrapped in “Midwestern”—first software, then strength. Same intent: lead well and build something that matters. Same lesson: the cost is real. Letting go wasn’t administrative; it was personal. I designed that brand. I cared about it. But we needed a clean standard, not just a fresh coat of paint. So we raised a new banner: Archetype Fitness Company.

People who loved Midwestern Built will remember it; I honor that. But the name we carry now has to match the standard we were going to start living—again.

Pocket rule: Standards change cultures; names reveal them.

Archetype: returning to the pattern

Archetype means the original pattern—the thing you build from, not a copy you chase. That was the point: stop compensating, start telling the truth about who we are.

Plain terms: we’re a class-based gym in Carthage. Leaders and coaches design programs that serve every level—first-timers and veterans in the same room, each with a way forward. Body and mind strengthen each other. Structure matters. So does challenge. Community shapes outcomes. Respect first. Encouragement in the open. Accountability without theater. A room that’s safe to fail in becomes a room where people try harder things.

We believe people are made in the image of God. That conviction sits under how we lead: serve first, tell the truth, protect dignity, keep access wide, build something that outlives us. We don’t press that belief onto anyone. We refuse to separate it from our story.

Mission—simple enough for a wall, strong enough for a Tuesday at 3 p.m.: help people get better—body, mind, and spirit.

The phoenix became our mark, not because it’s clever but because it’s honest. Everyone faces fire—illness, doubt, loss, failure. Rising isn’t pretending the fire didn’t happen. It’s rebuilding afterward—stronger, steadier, with people around you who care if you make it. There’s a resurrection echo in that for me. I won’t pretend otherwise.

When we shared the rebrand with core Carthage members—the people who quietly held the place together—the room didn’t cheer; it settled. Heads nodded. Tense shoulders dropped. The questions were right: Will programming still serve every level? Will events keep the same heart? Will this invite more people in or push them out? My answer was steady: we aren’t erasing our past; we’re naming what you already feel. “Archetype” fit the room. Within days the new name showed up where it matters—on apparel, in text threads, in the way folks invited their friends. Oxygen.

Not my dream—still my duty

The gym wasn’t my dream. I started as a member and investor. I’m not a fitness expert; I’m an owner who cares about people and systems. Archetype is me holding the center long enough for the one with the dream—Brock—to fully step into it.

Servant leadership looks like that more often than we admit. Sometimes you take ownership of something you’re not passionate about because you are passionate about people it connects you to. You carry what isn’t “your thing” so someone else can do their thing. You flatten the road so the next steward can run harder. You don’t need a spotlight to carry the moment; you need standards that protect people while the work matures.

That posture changed how I showed up. In Joplin I lived on the floor—present, absorbing, guarding. In Carthage I could train first and steward always. I still shook hands, said thanks, and watched edges, but there wasn’t a daily fire to put out. Healthier culture changes a leader’s job description: fewer interventions, more formation.

How Archetype actually works

Carthage had been mostly healthy for years and was largely insulated from what plagued Joplin. It had its own share of challenges, but it was always very interesting to me how different the community was. They chose to stand together rather than be blown apart. Brock runs the day-to-day clean: steady classes, clear expectations, attention on humans before numbers. My role sits upstream—own the standard, keep the guardrails, protect the mission, and make the calls that outlive any single class.

What that means in practice:

People & trust. We select coaches who can lead the room and protect dignity at the same time. We defend them in public and coach them in private. When a seam pops, we fix it now—not after a season.

Respect the room. Whiteboard means quiet—no bar-drop punctuation, no side programming drowning out the coach. Members aren’t props; they’re the point. That expectation translates to any business: protect the moment where your work meets the person you serve.

Access without drift. The scholarship lane stays open. Money shouldn’t lock out people who belong here. We invite sponsorships that widen access without bending values.

Clear lanes. Coaches own the craft. Leaders own the context. Owners own the standard. Crossing those lines creates noise; staying in them creates trust.

Accountability without theater. A small board of voices tells me the truth. No standing meetings. Short notes when decisions are big—move, risk, guardrail. Their job isn’t to run the gym; it’s to keep me honest when compromise looks clever.

Communication with a center. We say the quiet parts early—what’s changing, why it’s changing, what members can count on. Less mystique, more clarity. Clarity beats drama every time.

A word on programming. We keep it for every level. Not watered down—scaled. Strength cycles are written with on-ramps and off-ramps. Conditioning blocks are built to challenge without humiliating anyone into silence. You can work hard without auditioning. That’s a moral choice as much as a coaching one.

A word on events. We still mark seasons—intramural throwdowns, simple benchmarks, bring-a-friend days. But none of it overshadows the daily class. Tuesday matters more than Saturday. Ordinary days are where people change.

A word on coaching culture. Coaches aren’t celebrities. They’re stewards. We expect them to know names, watch movement, and speak to the person in front of them—not to their own ambitions. If you’ve got a competitive goal, great—pursue it. In class, your first job is to serve the room.

Years on a sound board formed that posture in me: signal over spotlight. The job isn’t to be the loudest voice; it’s to make sure the right things are heard and the wrong noise doesn’t win.

Pocket rule: Own the standard; free the operators.

Faith in plain sight

We don’t turn classes into services. We also don’t hide our center. The Imago Dei conviction shows up in practical ways: how we correct without shaming; why we keep access wide; how we handle conflict (direct, private, honest); what we celebrate (effort and integrity before times and totals). It shows up in the way we talk about bodies—with gratitude, not contempt. And it shows up when someone hits a wall and needs more than a scaling option—they need a human to sit with them for a minute and remind them that starting again is still starting.

We keep the door open for anyone. We refuse to apologize for the values that make the place safe. That’s not culture war. That’s culture care.

More than a membership

We say this out loud: fitness is more than a membership—it’s a mission. The mission doesn’t stop at our doors. Some people won’t join our classes. We still serve them.

That looks like:

Simple on-ramps for people starting over—no shame, clear steps, a coach who remembers your name next time.

Community sessions anyone can attend—move, learn, ask basic questions without feeling exposed.
Content that teaches families how to move and eat without extremes. No magic. No hacks. Just patient work.

Bridge help when a member hits a financial pothole. Quiet, targeted, accountable. Dignity intact.

Partnerships with local orgs to host lift-and-learn nights or wellness basics for teams who’ve never felt welcome in a gym.

None of that makes us famous. It makes us useful.

Outside the walls, my work has space again. I’m mentoring and consulting—quiet, targeted help where I can add clarity without taking a seat that isn’t mine. A nonprofit needs processes so passion doesn’t cannibalize the mission. A trades company wants a hiring flow that protects culture without gatekeeping talent. A pastor asks how to rebuild elder accountability without burning the church down. These aren’t “gigs.” They’re extensions of the same conviction: guardrails set people free.

Rebuilding the builder

Two things had to be rebuilt after the sale: the gym’s name and me. I never measured health with bravado. I measure it by basic obedience: am I keeping promises? Am I telling the truth? Am I sleeping? Am I training four to six days a week without making it a penance? Am I eating in a way that supports life, not control? Am I honoring Carie with time and attention that isn’t spent? Am I limiting the adrenaline habits I picked up when everything felt like a fight?

Some days I do that well. Some days I do it clumsily. But I do it. That slow rebuild is part of Archetype’s honest story: the room is for people, including the guy who owns the building.

Peace is coming back the way exhaustion arrived—quietly. You notice it when an email doesn’t make you flinch. When you sleep and actually recover. When thirty minutes under a bar doesn’t require adrenaline to count. When a coach corrects a miss without defensiveness. When a member says, “I brought a friend because it feels safe here.”

I don’t confuse peace with arrival. It’s a green light: keep going. Fewer public battles, more private repair. Fewer declarations, more decisions. Less “watch me,” more “let me watch you do it.”

That’s the part of my story I can tell and I’m sticking to it.
