Values on paper don’t make a culture. You can write them down, put them on the wall, or rehearse them in meetings, but until they are lived, they’re just words. After the DNA of servant leadership was set—service, protection, accountability—the next test was whether we could make those values real.

When I say we in this chapter, I mean the team. They were the ones who carried these rhythms and lived them out every day. My role was to set the DNA and lead with conviction, but the culture was theirs as much as it was mine.

This was the season where culture took shape. Not as theory, but as practice. The systems, the ceremonies, the boundaries, and the investments were all ways of telling people they mattered. From the outside, some of it looked ordinary—huddles, celebrations, transparency—but inside, it was the difference between survival and trust. It was what made us strong enough to carry one another when the weight got heavy.

Rhythms & Ceremonies

Culture is built on what you repeat, not what you announce. For our team, the heartbeat of that repetition was communication.

We held daily stand-ups and huddles because the work demanded it. In a business as complex as ours, there were always dozens of moving parts—and just as many opportunities to let something slip. I used to say all the time, “Don’t drop the ball.” Those meetings were how we made sure of it. They gave everyone clarity on priorities, surfaced issues before they became problems, and kept people from being left on islands. Most companies leave people guessing. We didn’t.

Looking back, the systems we had in place looked a lot like SCRUM or other Agile project-management ceremonies. Daily stand-ups, backlog grooming, sprint reviews—all of that eventually became part of our formal playbook once we installed a project-management team. But long before we had names for them, we had the instincts. We knew we needed to communicate daily, to make priorities visible, and to create space for constant course correction. Servant leadership demanded it.

But here’s the real reason we did it: I knew the human behind the task mattered more than the task itself. The policies, the systems, the procedures—even the celebrations—weren’t about efficiency alone. They were about dignity. They were about telling every person on the team, “You matter.” Yes, the work had to get done, but the greater work was showing people they weren’t just cogs in a process. They were seen, valued, and part of something bigger.

The celebrations layered on top of that backbone. Friday brunch, birthdays, new houses, anniversaries, even Beer:30—all of it mattered, but it was secondary. The celebrations reinforced belonging. The rhythms created trust.

And that consistency is what made the culture solid. People didn’t have to wonder if they were seen, if their voice mattered, or if someone else knew what they were carrying. The rhythms made sure no one was left behind, and the ceremonies reminded them they were more than just their work.

MWI Cares

As the team grew, I realized two things were true. First, people don’t always like talking with the boss about their problems—especially personal ones. Even though I worked hard to foster openness, there were still barriers. Second, I wasn’t equipped to carry everything myself. I wasn’t a woman, and as our team grew to include incredible women, I knew they needed safe spaces I couldn’t fully provide.

That’s where MWI Cares came from. It wasn’t just another HR program. It was an intentional structure that created safe, trusted channels for people to get help. In an industry like tech—where studies consistently show women face higher rates of burnout, attrition, and exclusion—it mattered even more to build something that said, “You belong here, and your needs matter.”

MWI Cares created space for all of it. Sometimes that meant covering significant medical expenses. Sometimes it meant paying for counseling. Sometimes it was smaller, quieter needs that never made headlines but made all the difference in someone’s life. The point wasn’t the size of the expense. The point was that no one had to carry their burdens alone.

The clearest picture of this was what came to be known as the crying couch. One of our designers hit a breaking point. The details aren’t mine to share, but what mattered was that they weren’t left to fall apart in isolation. Work stopped, and presence took priority. I sat with them, listened, and carried what I could. No fixing, no rushing—just being there.

That’s what servant leadership looks like. Not rushing past pain, but giving it space. Not treating people like a task to be managed, but like a human to be honored. The crying couch was never part of an employee manual, but it defined us more than any policy ever could.

MWI Cares wasn’t about fixing everything. It was about making sure every person knew there was a path to care. It told the team: You are more than the code you write or the designs you ship. You are human, and you matter.

The 80/20 Rule

One of the most important decisions I made as a leader was to build margin into the way we worked. For us, it became the 80/20 rule.

The idea was simple: if 100% of your effort goes into production, you leave no time for progress. People burn out. Growth stalls. Creativity disappears. That wasn’t the kind of culture I wanted to build.

The 80/20 rule gave the team permission—and accountability—to keep moving forward in both work and life. It meant space for learning, refining, and building better systems. It meant they weren’t chained to the urgent at the expense of the important. Paradoxically, when we pulled back from chasing productivity at all costs, productivity actually increased—dramatically.

It also created space for leadership itself. Some business leaders today have lost sight of this. They believe if you’re not producing, you’re nothing. But that isn’t true. Teams need leaders. Teams even need managers. Those roles may not be billable from a revenue perspective, but they are productive in the truest sense. They foster progress by growing the people around them.

This wasn’t a one-time idea. It was daily. I used these rhythms to keep my hand on the pulse of the team. Were they making progress? Were they thriving? Were they carrying weight in a sustainable way? The 80/20 rule gave me the framework to check in and make adjustments before cracks formed.

And the result was unmistakable. When you do more than tell people they matter—when you actually structure their time to prove it—it leaves a mark. People feel safer. They feel freer to be creative. They burn out less. That was the whole point.

Growth, Health, and Wellness

We didn’t want to build workers. We wanted to build people. That meant investing in their growth, health, and wellness as much as their output.

When growth required it, we invested. That meant covering certifications, training, and other opportunities that helped people move forward. These weren’t blank checks for personal whims—there had to be a foundation of skill already in place, and the growth had to matter. If development was necessary for their advancement and for the health of the team, we funded it. Our aim was simple: keep people advancing, not stagnating.

Health was just as important. A lot of it was woven into the events we already loved. Fitness is hard, but it gets easier when you do it side by side with others. We encouraged ten-minute walks every hour. Most of the time those walks weren’t just about steps on a counter—they became opportunities for conversations, relationships, and problem-solving. Some of the best ideas came while moving.

We even created themes to keep this front and center. Every May we had “Be Kind To Your Mind” month. During that season, the emphasis shifted to mental health. We built in educational sessions, trainings, and conversations that had little to do with client work but everything to do with growing as whole humans.

The conviction behind it was simple. People matter more than the task. They definitely matter more than profits. Trading a little cash for a healthier, stronger, more whole human is always the right decision. Trading a human’s well-being for profit is always wrong.

Transparency

For me, transparency was never about rare moments of revelation. It was about consistency. I didn’t wait for a crisis to pull people in. I shared as often as I could—finances, strategy, opportunities, struggles. If a decision was going to affect the team, they deserved to know about it.

What is there really to hide in business? Every choice a leader makes lands on the people doing the work. Pretending otherwise doesn’t protect them, it just blindsides them. I wanted the team to know the reality they were living in—good, bad, or uncertain.

That consistency built trust that has lasted far beyond the years we worked together. Many of the relationships I still have with former staff trace back to this posture. They trusted me then, and they still trust me now, because they never had to wonder what was happening behind closed doors.

Transparency wasn’t a tactic. It was a way of leading. It said, “You are part of this story. You’re not just here to execute decisions. You deserve to see them, understand them, and carry them with me.”

Closing — Why Culture Held

Looking back, I don’t see these decisions as extras. They were the culture. Daily rhythms that kept us aligned. MWI Cares that reminded people they weren’t alone. The 80/20 rule that gave margin for growth. Health and wellness that valued the whole person. Transparency that left no doubt about trust.

None of these practices were glamorous. They didn’t make headlines. But they became the strength of our team. They made it possible for people to thrive, not just produce. They created a foundation we would need when the harder seasons came.

Culture isn’t built in crisis. It’s revealed there. And because we built it here, when the weight showed up later—in moments of grief, conflict, and strain—we weren’t crushed by it. The culture held.
