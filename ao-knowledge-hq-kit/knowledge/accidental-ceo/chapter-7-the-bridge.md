The Sale

July 1, 2022, was supposed to feel like a triumph. In many ways, it did.

I had built something over the course of a thirty-year career that held enough value to give me a long, well-funded runway into whatever came next. For the first time in my life, I had margin. I could breathe financially. I was able to help my kids in ways that mattered — not just token gifts, but significant steps forward for their lives.

I bought my mom a van. It was a thank-you for the life she and my father had given me when they adopted me as an infant. I gave generously to our church. I did the things I had always hoped success would let me do. On the outside, it looked like I was living my best life — and in many ways, I was.

But on the inside, I was crushed.

Some of the people I had spent years in the trenches with — people who had shared boardrooms, deadlines, and vision-casting sessions with me — acted as if I was no longer welcome. Whether they hated me or not wasn’t the point. The message was clear: I wasn’t wanted anymore.

That dissonance nearly tore me in two. Outwardly, I was thriving. Inwardly, I was grieving.

Pocket rule: Wealth can widen your reach, but it can’t fill the silence of being unwanted.

The Silence

I had nine days.

That was it — nine days where I thought maybe, just maybe, this might work out. Nine days of waking up without the crushing schedule, without the endless crises, without the pressure to carry more than was human. Nine days of thinking there might finally be space for rest, for health, for something resembling balance.

July 9, 2022, it was gone.

Nine days of breathing room turned into “all in” on the next mess. Screw being healthy. Screw resting. The bridge I thought might be space to recover became nothing more than a handoff into another battle.

That season taught me something about servant leadership I hadn’t seen as clearly before: kindness is often misread as weakness. I had chosen the noble way out at MWI. I hadn’t fought for scraps of authority. I had let go with dignity. But in the eyes of others, that restraint looked like permission. It was time to take advantage of me.

Pocket rule: Servant leadership is not submission — it is sacrifice with strength intact.

I wasn’t weak. I had always led by giving people the benefit of the doubt. That’s the reflex of a servant leader. You assume the best. You extend grace. You trust first. But there comes a time when grace has to be paired with grit. When the role of a servant leader isn’t to absorb, but to act.

Pocket rule: Sometimes the kindest thing a leader can do is draw a hard line.

The silence after MWI wasn’t rest. It was the moment before another storm.

The Hollow Role

I never needed power or authority. Ego wasn’t what drove me. What mattered was having a voice, a seat at the table where culture was shaped and people were protected.

When I sat down at my desk for the first time as COO in mid-August, I looked out my window and saw activity buzzing through the office. The company was moving forward — but without me. In just forty-five days, it hadn’t only moved on, it had begun to reject my way of leading altogether.

Within just a couple weeks, that became clearest in one meeting I’ll never forget. I didn’t ask to be there. In fact, the only reason I was in the room was because other leaders didn’t want to be. They avoided the confrontation, and it landed in my lap by default. It was token, patronizing — likely with the expectation that I’d do what I eventually did: walk away.

The conversation turned toward “birthing people.” Maybe that kind of ideology had been simmering just under the surface all along, but hearing it spoken as the new language of the company broke something in me. I watched as women and mothers — roles I believe carry a God-given significance in a healthy society — were reduced by sterile terminology. It wasn’t just about words. Words were the doorway to action, and the goal was to strip dignity in both.

Sitting there, I realized that even if I had wanted to push back, my ability to lead had already been stripped of any real impact. To raise my voice would have meant war, and I no longer had the authority to fight one.

Pocket rule: When leaders avoid the hard things, they leave others to carry wounds they won’t even claim.

It was a hurtful, empty place to sit — watching a culture I had poured my life into slide away, while knowing I no longer had the strength or the standing to call it back.

Aftershock

By October 2022, I had officially stepped away from MWI. I told myself it was the right thing to do — dignified, necessary, even healthy. But grief doesn’t operate on a schedule.

The aftershock hit in November.

I was sitting on a plane bound for Arizona, ready for a CrossFit competition, when my phone buzzed. On the other end came the news: three of my closest team members — the marketing team I had personally hired, mentored, and fought for — had been terminated without warning.

There was nowhere to go, nowhere to hide. My head hit my hands. The tears came. Right there in public, on that plane, I felt helpless.

The sting ran deeper because the shift hadn’t been sudden. A year earlier, I had already seen that team handed off in a way that troubled me. They were placed under someone who, though skilled in design and fluent in marketing theory, lacked the experience to truly lead people. What mattered most in that moment wasn’t protecting culture, but aligning with profit and direction. That choice spoke volumes about what kind of leadership was being elevated — and what kind was being left behind.

So when the call came, it wasn’t just the shock of their departure. It was the final blow in a story I had already watched unfold in slow motion.

But my response afterward was the only kind I knew how to give: I helped them land on their feet. Carie and I threw our weight behind them. We worked our networks, opened doors, and celebrated each win. And one by one, they found jobs that fit them. Every single one landed well.

Pocket rule: If you can’t protect people where they are, then you fight to send them somewhere they’ll thrive.

The Weight I Carried

By December, the full weight of the gym had landed squarely on my shoulders. There was no cushion, no buffer, no team of executives to share the load. It was me.

And the weight wasn’t one-dimensional.

On one side was survival. The mortgage had to be paid. Payroll was non-negotiable. Equipment, utilities, insurance — the bills didn’t care about culture, they demanded cash. From July of 2022 until March of 2025, we were losing between eight and ten thousand dollars every single month. I know that number because I wrote the check. Thirty-four months in a row. Each one carving away a little more of my margin, my reserves, my strength.

It wasn’t just the math. It was the dysfunction piled on top of it — decisions that made no sense, energy wasted in conflict instead of building, constant fires that drained more than they produced. The weight wasn’t only financial, it was cultural.

And all of it was pressing down on me at a time when my own health was already in decline. My body had been sending warning signals for years, but now they were impossible to ignore. The pressure made every symptom worse. Some days it felt like leadership had turned into a deadly game, and I was the only one left at the table. Maybe that sounds like an overstatement. But it’s not far from the truth I was living.

On the other side was something even more important to me: people. From the beginning, I had believed a gym should be more than a place to sweat. It should be a place where anyone — any age, gender, fitness level, or background — could find belonging and success. That vision wasn’t optional. It was the soul of the place. And if it was going to survive, that soul had to be protected.

So I carried both sides — the spreadsheets and the spirit.

Some days it felt like trying to lift with one arm strapped behind my back. Some days it felt like a fight I couldn’t win. But I kept showing up, because the alternative was to let it all burn.

Pocket rule: Sometimes the heaviest weight a leader carries isn’t the numbers, it’s the people who will be crushed if the numbers win.

The bridge wasn’t a pause. It wasn’t a chance to rest. It was a crucible — a place where everything I had left was tested.

Lineage callout: This was Greenleaf’s “stewardship” under fire — the test of whether I would protect both the mission and the people, even when it cost me everything.
