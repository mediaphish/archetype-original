Chapter 18: Trust is the Currency — Earn It Daily

Theology

Leadership rises and falls on trust. You can have vision, strategy, and a plan, but if your people don’t trust you, it’s all just noise. Without trust, even good ideas feel like a threat. Without trust, standards feel like control. Without trust, change feels like betrayal. Leaders who don’t understand this try to compensate with pressure. They push harder, grow louder, or hide behind policy. It doesn’t work. When trust is thin, people protect themselves. When trust is strong, they protect the mission. Without it, a team will endure just long enough to find the exit. With it, they’ll endure when the pressure hits. With it, they’ll move mountains.

In 2023, Gallup studied over 100,000 teams across 122 countries and found one simple truth: trust changes everything. When employees strongly agreed that they trusted their leaders, they were 5.4 times more likely to be engaged and 7 times more likely to say their work had purpose. Teams with low trust reported more burnout, absenteeism, and turnover. That data isn’t theory—it’s proof that culture rises or falls on relational equity.

When people trust leadership, they stop calculating risk with every decision. Energy once spent on self-protection gets redirected toward performance. It’s not a soft concept; it’s a measurable productivity gain.

Pocket rule: Where trust grows, resistance shrinks

Bad leaders try to buy trust with perks, charisma, or authority. Managers try to mandate it with policy and performance plans. Neither works for long. Servant leaders know trust has to be earned, and earned daily.
The Fragility and Cost of Trust

Trust is slow to build and quick to lose. Gallup’s research shows engagement rises with trusted leaders, but you don’t need a study to see it. When people trust their leaders, they show up different—more creative, more resilient, more generous.

In two years of data across 180 teams, Google’s Project Aristotle reached a simple conclusion: the strongest predictor of team effectiveness wasn’t seniority, talent density, or incentives—it was psychological safety (trust made operational). Where safety was high, ideas surfaced earlier, conflict stayed about the work, and teams kept learning instead of hiding mistakes. Subsequent HBR reviews (2022–2024) point the same direction: teams that report high trust show higher learning behavior and meaningfully better retention over time.

That’s what I saw in practice. When trust is present, people stop editing themselves. You get the real signal sooner—what’s broken, what’s possible, and what needs to change. Progress speeds up because the room isn’t wasting energy on self-protection.

Pocket rule: Psychological safety isn’t comfort; it’s permission to tell the truth.

When that trust erodes, everything contracts. It gets smaller. People default to self-preservation. They stop taking risks. They only do what’s required. Then predictably, the organization adds more oversight, more turnover, more missed opportunities.

That’s why I never assumed trust was automatic. It didn’t matter how long someone had worked with me or how many wins we had behind us—trust still had to be earned in the present tense. Not banked on the past. Not borrowed against the future. Earned now. One choice, one decision, one interaction, one conversation at a time.

Stories

Daily Deposits

For me, those deposits weren’t complicated. They looked like showing up early and staying late without making a scene about it. They looked like answering questions honestly the first time they were asked, then answering them again when someone needed to hear it differently.

A 2023 Harvard Business Review analysis of forty-two organizations tracked how leaders built or lost credibility over time. The clearest signal wasn’t empathy or inspiration—it was follow-through. When employees strongly agreed that their leaders “did what they said they would do,” engagement scores were 38 percent higher, and voluntary turnover fell by nearly half over twelve months. The pattern held across industries and pay scales.

Consistency is the quiet proof of integrity. Every kept promise deposits confidence into the account you lead from. Every missed one withdraws more than words can repay. That’s why trust is rarely rebuilt with a speech—it’s rebuilt with repetition.

Pocket rule: Trust compounds through repetition, not revelation.

They looked like writing things on the whiteboard where everyone could see them—priorities, timelines, responsibilities—and standing there long enough to make sure silence didn’t hide confusion.

We also made it tangible. Lunches catered in once a week, breakfast drop-ins on busy project days, and an open-door policy that wasn’t just a phrase. It was the whole posture: be interruptible. Be present. If I had to choose between a perfect plan and a present leader, I’d choose presence every time. People didn’t trust me because of the perks, but because the culture had become magnetic.

But the real deposits weren’t in breakfasts or Friday happy hours. They were in the small, quiet moments that no one posts on social media. A late-night text answered. A hard conversation handled with dignity. A correction made in private and an affirmation given in public. We had those moments on repeat. We respected the room. We let the coach have the floor. We laid out standards when it was time and then got out of the way so people could work. And we celebrated, supported, or carried the weight of every one of those moments as a team.

And we grieved together too. The deepest test of trust came when we lost one of our own.

Sevie was my project, my right hand in the design world, and my friend. She died too young, and it ripped a hole in all of us. She was brave, talented, and honest. She made me better and kept me honest. I loved who she was. Even though she’s gone, I still do. Her life and her loss shaped the way I lead. That’s part of why I carry her with me in the tattoo on my arm with her favorite phrase: “Wage War.”

Moments like these are where trust either fractures or forges. Ours forged. I didn’t have to pretend I was strong. I didn’t have to perform. We showed up for each other. We were present. The work continued because the work had purpose—not in spite of the loss, but because our trust was already deep. And in the aftermath, it only grew deeper.

I hesitate to call it family, because that word is thrown around too easily in business. It can become a manipulative way to demand loyalty without earning it. What we had was different. We had a culture where trust pulled the best out of people and sent it out into the world. A place where the standard is high, but the grace is higher. Where the point isn’t to keep you forever but to grow you into someone who outgrows the room and teaches your potential, so you can go out and change the world.

At scale, that language has to shift. I only had 104 people at our largest, so we could still build trust through presence. In larger organizations, you need rituals and systems that carry trust beyond proximity. At that point, the leader’s job is to turn personal posture into a cultural expectation, not just the owner’s personal posture.

And this doesn’t fall only on leaders. Employees carry responsibility too. If you want to be trusted, be trustworthy. Deliver on time. Communicate clearly. Own your misses. Don’t hide behind the “that’s above my pay grade” line. Don’t choose the easy path of cynicism or gossip. Don’t protect yourself at all costs. That posture is a trust-killer.

For those who want to lead, even if they don’t have the title yet: make deposits first. Carry weight that isn’t yours yet. Be the one who goes first. Trust travels both directions when people live like that. And it can be built. It is possible on both sides, no matter the size of the company.

The result was a team that ran hot without burning out. Pressure didn’t scatter us; it bonded us. We weren’t perfect, but we were in it together, and they wanted to be part of the climb.

The Trust Ledger

I never sat down with a spreadsheet or a notebook to track credibility. That’s not how it works. Trust isn’t math. It isn’t accounting. It isn’t a game you keep score on.

The ledger was lived. People were counting, even when I wasn’t. They noticed if my yes stayed yes. They noticed if I showed up when I said I would. They noticed if I gave the same standard to everyone instead of protecting favorites.

Every leader has a ledger, whether they acknowledge it or not. It’s written in the minds of the people who experience you. Every action is either a deposit or a withdrawal.

MIT Sloan’s 2023 Trust Repair in Leadership study followed 2,500 employees through organizational crises and found that leaders who acknowledged failure quickly and took visible corrective action restored trust six times faster than those who minimized or deflected blame. The mechanism wasn’t apology alone—it was transparency paired with consistent behavior afterward.

Trust doesn’t just live in success; it’s proven in recovery. People don’t expect perfection—they expect truth followed by movement. Every time you face a hard moment honestly, you make a deposit in someone’s confidence that you’ll handle the next one the same way.

Pocket rule: Honesty repairs what silence breaks.

Withdrawals happen—silence, delay, inconsistency, pride. What separates leaders isn’t perfection. It’s honesty. When trust leaks, do you surface it fast? Do you repair it? Or do you pretend it didn’t happen?

The Trust Ledger is just a way of naming what was already happening. It wasn’t a tool I carried. It was the natural log of whether people could count on me, day in and day out.

Withdrawals and Repair

Trust doesn’t just depend on the deposits you make. It’s also about how you handle withdrawals when they inevitably happen. Missing a deadline without acknowledging it is a withdrawal. Making a decision that surprises the team because you didn’t communicate early is a withdrawal. Failing to apply the same standard to your favorites that you apply to everyone else is a withdrawal. People will forgive a lot when they trust you. What they won’t forgive is dishonesty, favoritism, or pride.

Repair is the hard part. It’s also the place where trust often grows the most. You repair by telling the truth. You repair by naming exactly what happened and why. You repair by apologizing without qualification and then fixing the process that let it happen. You repair by recommitting to the standard, not just to the relationship.

I learned that backing leaders in public and correcting in private was the best way to reduce withdrawals. It preserved dignity and reinforced alignment. When something blew up online, I shut down public chatter and handled it privately with the person involved. Then I showed up in the room and explained the standard again. Not louder, just clearer.

When it was my miss, I said so. That mattered as much as anything. People don’t need a perfect leader; they need an honest one.

And trust doesn’t just create stability—it accelerates growth. When a team fully trusts each other, the speed of decision-making increases. Accountability becomes shared rather than policed. People start to anticipate needs instead of waiting to be told. And when people anticipate, they start solving problems before they become fires. That’s the kind of organization that outlasts talent gaps and market swings. It becomes antifragile because its foundation isn’t dependent on one hero. It’s built on a thousand kept promises.

Trust also reduces the cost of operations. When people believe you, you don’t need as many approvals, as many meetings, or as much redundant oversight. The energy you save from arguing and defending can be spent on building.

Deloitte’s 2022 Human Capital Trends report found that organizations described by their own employees as “high-trust ecosystems” made decisions 30 percent faster and delivered strategic initiatives 40 percent more effectively than peers with low trust. The gain wasn’t from working longer hours—it came from cutting friction.

Bureaucracy is what grows in the absence of belief. Every approval chain or redundant meeting is a hedge against someone’s doubt. Remove that friction and people move without waiting for permission. The energy that once fueled defense now fuels progress.

Pocket rule: Speed is the dividend of trust.

Trust takes time to earn, but once it compounds, it pays for itself every day.

There is also a cost to losing it. Losing trust increases churn. It pushes your best people to the edges. It steals creativity and slows momentum. Losing even one key person can set a company back months.

I saw the power of trust firsthand with Kahlie. I’d known of her as a high school student with my boys, and fresh out of college I hired her to help me build and lead our project management team. We were starting from scratch, and the pressure was immense. The pace we had to sustain wasn’t forgiving, and we hit wall after wall trying to create a structure that could carry the weight of the work.

Kahlie was wired for detail. She loved processes and documentation, where I had to work harder at them. That difference could have turned into friction, but trust kept it from breaking down. We had some intense conversations—disagreements about path and approach—but there was mutual respect in every one of them. I trusted her enough to let her build. She trusted me enough to tell me when the system needed to change. We both stayed under the standard. We argued for the work, not for our egos. We shared the same aim: build a team that could carry others.

Within a couple of months, we had the structure. In a year, we had a strong department. And Kahlie had grown from an entry-level hire to a leader with a voice that changed the company. It was a steep climb from graduation to leadership, and she earned every step.

That’s what trust makes possible. It doesn’t just create harmony; it creates momentum. It opens doors that policies can’t. It empowers people to run faster because they know you won’t pull the rug out from under them. It’s how we built a department where none existed and launched a young leader into her calling.

And the return doesn’t stop when the job ends. Years later, I still carry pride for the people who came through our doors and outgrew us. That’s the right outcome. That’s the point. If you do this right, the trust you build outlasts your brand because it was never about the brand. It was always about the bond.

Takeaway

Now, can every leader personally maintain this kind of connection at scale? No. As you grow, you can’t be everywhere at once. But you can extend trust by raising up other leaders who carry the same convictions. You can codify standards so the culture protects itself. You can create rhythms where trust is taught, measured by outcomes, and reinforced.

That doesn’t mean creating clones in personality or style. Diversity of thought and approach is the strength of a healthy team. It means alignment in values and standards—between teammates, clients, vendors, and the wider community.

When that’s in place, trust compounds. It becomes the kind of return every business actually wants—return on relationship that shows up in quality, retention, and reputation. It’s the kind of revenue you get to choose: not revenue that fades, but relationships that remain.

At the end of the day, trust is the real currency of leadership. And once you’ve earned it, you have a responsibility to spend it on the right things: clarity, courage, and standards that free people to reach their potential. Say the hard thing because you love them, not because you’re right. That’s the next layer. And that’s where this book goes next—because the real climb continues when leaders say the hard things well.
