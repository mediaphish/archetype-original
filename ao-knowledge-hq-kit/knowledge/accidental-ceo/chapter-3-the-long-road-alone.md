Grinding Through the Years

Those years between 2004 and 2010 were defined by one word: grind. My days started at seven in the morning, getting the kids to school, and from there I was immediately on the clock. I would design and code all day, managing projects and communicating with team members scattered across the world until the kids came home. Then I shifted into the roles of husband, father, and coach until bedtime. Once the house quieted, I went right back to work, often until two or three in the morning. Then I’d sleep for a handful of hours, get up, and do it again. Wash, rinse, repeat.

I was exhausted all the time, but I didn’t let it stop me. In truth, I didn’t know how to stop. Sleep never came easy anyway. It wasn’t until 2024 that I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, but looking back, I believe it had been with me all along. That hidden condition explained a lot about why rest never felt restorative and why I believed I could simply power through without consequence. In those days, the ability to work twenty hours straight felt like a strength. Only later would I learn it came with a price tag that would show up in my health years down the road.

The work itself wasn’t light. One of my earliest contracts was with Motive Movie Marketing, where I built projects for Disney, Icon Films, and a handful of music labels. I was a tiny fish in a very big pond — building websites for Hollywood studios from a bedroom office in flyover country. The pressure was enormous, but it was also refining. I specifically worked on campaigns for The Chronicles of Narnia from Disney and The Passion of the Christ for Icon Films. With the latter, our team took Mel Gibson’s $25 million investment in distribution and multiplied it tenfold, driving $250 million in value through targeted group marketing. It still amazes me that I got to be part of that effort from my small corner of the world.

The expectations were extreme. Today, design and code are fluid, with flexible layouts and responsive systems. Back then, everything was inline. CSS wasn’t even a thing yet. I was handed finished studio designs and expected to translate them perfectly into web pages. And when I say “perfectly,” I mean it. Studio art directors would send notes asking me to move a graphic two pixels in one direction or another. Two dots on the screen. That was the level of precision they demanded.

At first, it was maddening. But over time, that discipline became training. I learned to find satisfaction in the tedium — to see those tiny corrections not as insults but as tools sharpening me. That season taught me to respect detail and to build systems that could handle exacting standards. It was the same discipline I would later expect from my team. Those two-pixel adjustments were preparing me for the next twelve to fifteen years, shaping how I would lead people whose skills far exceeded my own.

Carrying the Weight Together

Before the daycare years, our roles were actually flipped. Carie spent years selling cutting tools to machine shops while I was a “designer.” She was the one walking shop floors; I was the one pushing pixels. Later, when we leaned fully into being self-employed, she opened a daycare downstairs and I worked upstairs building the first iteration of what became Midwestern Interactive. It wasn’t typical by most people’s expectations, but it worked because we were aligned.

Midwestern Interactive (MWI) was the software firm I co-founded in 2012, but had been building since 2005. What started as a solo operator in a home office turned into more than 100 diverse humans in multiple locations, testing everything I believed about leadership and culture.

We were both tapped all the time. Three kids, a home, cars, bills, and the weight of building something new pressed on us constantly. There were days, weeks, and months where I couldn’t explain how we made it through. The pressure was relentless, but the provision was just as steady. We never went without. We never lacked what we needed.

The only explanation I have is God’s hand. I can’t take ownership of any part of the story that carried us through those years. Looking back over the whole thirty-two-year timeline, it’s clear: God did it all. It was His path for me and for my family. That conviction didn’t make the grind easier, but it made it worth it.

Learning to Be Second

Those years also taught me a truth I’ve never let go of: I’m not special because I own something or lead something. No one is. The grind of working alone, the exhaustion, the constant dependence on God’s provision — all of it birthed the conviction I’ve lived by ever since: I am second.

I could never look back at those years and pretend I had done it all myself. God was carrying me and my family the whole way. That reality put me in a posture of service. Leadership was never about power, ego, or even financial gain. It was about building something greater than myself — not just a company, but a culture.

To this day, when I see someone achieve a dream, win a championship, or even notch a small victory in life, I celebrate it. Even if they beat me, good for them. That posture — choosing to celebrate others instead of centering myself — became the reason I existed as a leader. And I believe it’s also why I found so much success in what some would call a short timeline.
