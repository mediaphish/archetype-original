# Chapter 16: Sacrifice Builds Influence

## Theology

### Authority Is Earned by What You Give Up

Leadership is costly. Every real leader knows it. Titles may give you authority, but sacrifice is what earns you influence. People don’t follow a leader because of what they claim; they follow because of what they’ve seen that leader give up.

Some sacrifices are practical. You give up time, money, comfort, even your own health at times, to shoulder weight your team can’t carry. Other sacrifices are more subtle, but no less costly. You give up ego. You give up the need for credit. You give up control, even when holding on would make you feel safer.

I’ve come to believe the best leaders are the ones who willingly give up the most.

Gallup’s 2023 global study on “trust-based leadership” found that when employees strongly agree their leader “puts the team’s interests ahead of their own,” engagement jumps by 64 percent and intent to stay nearly doubles. Self-sacrifice signals safety. When people see a leader give something up for them—a bonus, a weekend, or the credit—they stop wondering if the mission is real. They know it is.

**Pocket rule:** Give first. Trust follows.

Not in a performative, martyrdom way that makes the story about them, but in a steady, consistent way that proves to their people: I will put you first, even when it costs me.

That kind of sacrifice builds a kind of credibility no paycheck or title ever could. Over time, it deposits into a reservoir of trust. And when the hard moments come—and they always come—that reservoir is what keeps people following.

## Story

### Sacrifice in Practice

Leadership is sacrifice. Every decision, every hire, every training, every late night—each one is a trade. Something you have is given up so that your team, your company, or your culture can gain. Sometimes it’s money. Sometimes it’s time, sleep, or energy. Sometimes it’s recognition, comfort, or control. But it is always something.

I learned this not only in business, but in marriage and family. A healthy marriage is built on sacrifice—two people taking a posture of service, giving up what they want in the moment for the sake of what matters most in the long run. When one partner gets selfish, problems creep in. Leadership works the same way. It thrives when sacrifice is mutual, when the leader sets the tone by putting the needs of the whole above their own.

For me, that often meant giving up comfort at home to carry the weight of building a company. I was a husband and father first, but there were countless nights when I put my family to bed and then went back to the grind until sleep finally won. Then I woke up and did it again, six or seven days a week. It wasn’t glamorous, and it wasn’t about being a hero. It was simply the cost of leadership.

Some sacrifices were more invisible. My wife and kids will tell you I never went on a vacation without being on the clock. Every trip included a call, a meeting, or a crisis that pulled me away. I sacrificed my peace and my time, but so did my family. What no one else saw was how much effort it took to flip the switch between family and business, sometimes multiple times in the same day. On the surface it looked seamless, but it took everything I had.

Other sacrifices were financial. In April and May of 2022, just months before the sale of Midwestern Interactive, the company was in a cash-poor position. To keep the business stable and my people paid, I went two months without a salary. Sure, I had reserves, but at the peak of our success I traded my own safety to make sure my staff had what they needed. Eventually I received what was due, but in the short term I gave up mine for their sake. Nobody outside the executive office ever knew.

Sacrifice isn’t always dramatic or visible. It’s often hidden. It’s often quiet. But it’s always costly. And it’s always the toll you pay for influence.

A 2022 Harvard Business Review analysis of 3,200 managers showed that leaders who consistently shared credit and absorbed blame built teams scoring 31 percent higher on trust and 28 percent higher on collaboration. Quiet sacrifice works because it resets fairness: people feel seen when a leader shields them but never steals their spotlight. The payoff isn’t applause—it’s alignment.

**Pocket rule:** Credit is loud when you hand it away.

## Takeaways

### Contrast — False vs. True Sacrifice

Not every “sacrifice” builds influence. Some of it is manipulation dressed up as generosity.

False sacrifice gives with strings attached. The quiet question behind it is always, “What’s in it for me?” Favors are traded. Debts are created. Influence is bought, not earned. And before long, the leader ends up in someone else’s pocket—under another’s control—because their so-called “sacrifice” was really a transaction. That kind of posture doesn’t build trust; it poisons it. People sense when a gift is really leverage in disguise.

The other failure is when leaders refuse to sacrifice at all. They guard their comfort, their credit, and their control while everyone else pays the cost. That may hold things together in the short term, but it always unravels. Teams will not follow a leader who only takes.

True sacrifice is different. It’s not transactional. It has no IOUs.

Robert K. Greenleaf’s original servant-leadership essays observed that genuine service—given with no expectation of return—creates what he called “moral authority.” Modern data echo it: Deloitte’s Human Capital Trends 2023 found organizations where leaders model altruistic decision-making are 2.6× more likely to earn “high trust” scores from employees. Influence born from cost outlasts influence bought with rewards.

**Pocket rule:** No return expected—just results earned.

It costs the leader something—time, money, peace, sleep, comfort, ego, or control—so that others can gain what they need. That kind of sacrifice builds durable trust because it proves motive. People may not remember every speech you gave, but they will not forget when you paid a cost so they didn’t have to.

I’ve seen this difference play out. In businesses where sacrifice was transactional, trust evaporated. People weren’t inspired; they were indebted. They worked out of obligation, not loyalty. In places where leaders truly sacrificed—where the motive was clean and the cost was real—people leaned in. They worked harder, stayed longer, and grew deeper because they knew the leader was for them, not for themselves.

Research backs this up. Studies on psychological safety (Edmondson, Harvard) show that trust and openness collapse when people feel manipulated. Employees may comply in the short term, but creativity, innovation, and retention plummet. On the flip side, Gallup reports that employees who feel cared for—whose leaders clearly give something up for their sake—are 3.2 times more likely to be engaged and 55% less likely to be looking for another job.

That’s the power of true sacrifice. It builds the kind of influence no title can manufacture, and no paycheck can buy.

MIT Sloan’s 2023 leadership study on “shared hardship” found that teams whose leaders personally took on extra workload during crisis periods reported 35 percent higher resilience and 40 percent higher discretionary effort. Shared cost turns influence into allegiance—it proves the leader is one of them, not above them.

**Pocket rule:** Carry weight with them, not for them.

### Sacrifice as Legacy

Sacrifice is the cost of leadership, but it is also its proof. People may forget your speeches, your strategies, even your titles, but they will not forget your sacrifices. Those moments are sticky because they reveal what you value most.

Sacrifice proves love in a marriage. It proves commitment in a family. And it proves character in leadership. The principle is the same across every sphere of life: when you willingly give up something you could have kept for yourself, you send a message stronger than words—you matter more than my comfort.

I don’t believe influence is something you can demand. You can’t legislate loyalty or purchase trust. Real influence is given by those you lead, and it’s given in response to sacrifice. Every time a leader lays down ego, control, money, recognition, or rest for the sake of others, they deposit into the bank of trust. Over time, that’s what turns authority into leadership, and leadership into legacy.

It’s also what separates servant leadership from martyrdom. Martyrdom makes the story about the leader’s suffering. Servant leadership makes the story about the people who grew, healed, or thrived because of the leader’s sacrifice. That’s the kind of story worth telling.

For leaders in small and mid-sized businesses—10 to 250 people—this principle is magnified. You’re close enough that your sacrifices are visible. Your people notice when you take the hit so they don’t have to. They notice when you give up credit to elevate someone else. They notice when you lay down comfort to protect the culture. And those moments shape the culture more than any vision speech ever could.

In the end, leadership is not measured by what you gained but by what you gave away. The sacrifices are costly, yes, but they are also the seeds of lasting influence. If people can look back on their time under your leadership and say, “That’s where I was protected. That’s where I was trusted. That’s where I was worth the cost,” then you’ve built something that outlives you.

That’s the legacy of sacrifice. And that’s the kind of leadership the world is desperate for.
