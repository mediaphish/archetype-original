# Chapter 12: Do the Work

## Theology

### Receipts Over Rhetoric

Leadership breaks down when leaders rely on words without proof. I’ve sat in meetings where someone at the top looked the staff in the eye, smiled, and said, “Everything’s great. Keep up the good work.” But you could feel it in the room—people didn’t buy it. The numbers didn’t line up. The workload didn’t match. The story and the reality were at odds. People aren’t fools. They can smell spin a mile away.

That’s the danger of rhetoric without receipts. Words are cheap. They’re easy to put on posters or recite in a speech. But without action behind them, they don’t just fall flat—they damage trust. Once your team learns that what you say doesn’t show up in what you do, they stop listening. The more you talk, the less they believe.

I never wanted to lead that way. From the beginning, I carried a deep conviction that if I said something, it had to be backed up with action. Every meeting, every event, every promise needed movement that people could see and feel. Otherwise, I was just another leader blowing smoke.

Over thirty-plus years, I didn’t lead perfectly, but I did lead consistently. I backed words with tangible effort, sometimes in big ways, often in small ways. Hundreds of small decisions added up to credibility my people could count on. If I said we were investing in our people, they saw new pathways for growth the next week. If I said we were doing well financially, they didn’t just hear it—they saw the numbers—and knew how it affected them. If I said I cared, they didn’t have to take my word for it. They had places to go, people to talk to, and systems that proved it.

That’s what I want this chapter to drive home: leadership is proved in action, not in announcements. Your people don’t need another slogan. They need receipts. They need to see that what you say is already in motion, or at least backed with a clear, tangible next step. Words alone can’t hold weight. Action does.

The data tells the same story everywhere. Gallup’s 2024 global survey found that employees who believe their leader models the behaviors they ask of others are more than three times as likely to be engaged. McKinsey’s “Trust Through Competence” research added that when people view leadership decisions as both fair and capable, productivity jumps by roughly 40 percent. Zenger & Folkman’s decade of leadership data closed the loop: teams whose leaders consistently keep small promises—returning calls, closing feedback loops, finishing what they start—deliver nearly double the discretionary effort.

Those aren’t academic footnotes; they’re proof that credibility isn’t charisma—it’s math. You build it one finished task at a time until the room stops questioning whether you’ll follow through. When words and action start matching, people relax into the rhythm. They stop performing for approval and start producing from trust. That’s how momentum compounds—through hundreds of small, verifiable acts that tell everyone in the room, you can count on me.

**Pocket rule: Credibility is earned in patterns, not posts.**

Employees aren’t fooled by spin. Gallup’s 2024 global report continues to show that only about a quarter of workers are truly engaged—which rises when managers pair words with visible proof. Credibility compounds when what you say is already in motion.

## Stories

### MWI Cares & the Crying Couch

At Midwestern Interactive, we spent a lot of time talking about how much we cared for our people. That wasn’t unusual—plenty of companies say they care. The difference was whether we could prove it. Talk only goes so far before people start looking around and asking, “Okay, but where’s the action?”

That’s why we created a system we called MWI Cares. It wasn’t just a slogan—it was a structure. The idea was simple: if an employee was struggling, whether with work or something personal, they had a clear pathway to talk to someone they trusted. Not a hotline. Not an HR form that disappeared into a file. A real, human conversation with a teammate who could help them find a way forward.

MWI Cares wasn’t just me. It was a team of people employees could go to, depending on who they felt most comfortable with. But for whatever reason, many ended up in my office. That’s how the crying couch got its reputation. It was a brand-new leather couch, nothing elaborate, but it became a safe place. Over time, team members sat there and poured out stories of stress, failure, broken relationships, or fear about the future. My role wasn’t to fix everything, but to listen, to guide, and to help them take the next right step. That’s leadership in action—not policy or platitude, but presence: sitting with someone in their pain and proving people mattered more than production.

When we announced MWI Cares, the action wasn’t delayed. We put it in place right away, and people began using it. The crying couch was proof that the system was more than words. Our staff learned quickly: when we said we cared, we had receipts. There was a couch, a team, a structure, and a culture that backed it up.

It sounds simple—but that simplicity is what gives it power. Employees didn’t have to wonder if we meant what we said. They experienced it. Every story shared in those conversations reinforced the truth that our culture wasn’t built on fluffy words. It was built on tangible action.

Clinical research backs why this works: dependable support and clear pathways reduce anxiety and increase performance. In plain terms—people do better work when they know where to go and that someone will meet them there.

### The 80/20 Rule — Investing in Growth, Health, and Wellness

Another way we made sure our words lined up with action was in how we structured the work itself. We often told our people that their growth mattered just as much as client production. But if all we did was repeat that line in meetings, it would have been nothing more than a hollow promise. To make it real, we built a system around it.

We set the expectation that 80% of a person’s week was for production—the client work that kept the business moving forward. The other 20% was reserved for growth—not free time, but investment time. It was the space to pursue training, education, certifications, health and wellness, or team-building activities. If we said we cared about our people, we had to give them time and resources to actually grow.

What we found was remarkable. That 80% often turned into more than 100% of typical output. When people were healthy, engaged, and growing, their work flowed with more efficiency, creativity, and energy. Instead of draining people dry with a “perform or die” mentality, we aligned body, mind, and spirit—and the results were exponential.

This wasn’t just an experiment in a software company. It became the heartbeat of how we later built Midwestern Built and continue to lead at Archetype Fitness Company.  
McKinsey’s 2023 research on human-capital velocity confirmed what experience already shows: organizations with cultures centered on learning and mentorship deliver 47 percent higher five-year shareholder return than those that treat talent as replaceable. The heartbeat you built is measurable—it’s what turns a company into a legacy.

**Pocket rule: People first isn’t soft—it’s scale.**

In every arena, the same truth held: when you invest in the whole person, the returns for both the human and the business multiply.

Research backs this up. Google’s famous “20% Time” policy gave engineers one day a week to work on projects outside their core responsibilities. The result? Breakthroughs like Gmail, AdSense, and Google News—proof that structured freedom produces exponential outcomes. Employee engagement studies have shown similar results: engaged teams are up to 43% more productive, and even slight boosts in happiness can raise output by 12%. Participative work design studies showed a jump from 67 to 82 units per hour when employees shaped their goals and pace—a 20% gain in productivity.

Our people didn’t need to read those reports to know it was true. They lived it. The 80/20 model wasn’t just a nice idea—it was proof that we backed our words with structures, time, and money that set them up to thrive.

### Financial Pathways — Income and Investing

One of the clearest ways leaders get exposed is when they talk about financial opportunity. I’ve heard plenty of leaders tell their people, “Stick with us, and you’ll be rewarded.” But unless there’s a visible path, it’s just talk. Hope without a plan is manipulation.

At Midwestern Interactive, we didn’t want our people to just believe in the company’s success—we wanted them to see how their own futures were tied to it. That meant creating real financial pathways for our staff.

The most obvious piece was income. We worked hard to pay fairly, and when people grew in skill or responsibility, we moved quickly to recognize that financially. But we didn’t stop there. Very early on, we introduced conversations about investing. Most of our staff hadn’t given much thought to it—they were young, talented, and focused on building their careers. Retirement felt like a lifetime away. But we knew the best time to start was while they were still young, so we created on-ramps.

For some, that meant setting up retirement accounts. For others, it meant coaching them to think about financial planning for the first time. It wasn’t glamorous or headline-worthy—but it was tangible. We weren’t just saying, “Your future matters.” We were proving it by helping them build a future they could actually touch.

The best part was seeing the shift in mindset. Once people realized the company wasn’t just extracting their time and energy, but investing in their long-term security, the trust deepened. They didn’t have to take my word for it. They could look at their paychecks, their benefits, their investment accounts, and see the receipts.

It would have been easy to make financial promises and never follow through. Many companies do. But our culture demanded more. We backed our words with pathways people could walk. That’s what credibility looks like in the financial arena: not hype, not vague promises, but real numbers people can build their lives on.

### Transparency — Showing the Numbers Before Talking

Another way we earned credibility was through transparency. I never wanted to be the kind of leader who told the team, “Everything’s fine,” when the truth was anything but. People aren’t fooled by pep talks that don’t match reality. They see the long hours. They hear the frustrated clients. They notice when momentum slows.

So instead of sugarcoating, we made it a practice to show the receipts first. When we had financial updates, we presented the numbers. When we had new projects in the pipeline, we named them. When we had staffing changes, we explained why. More often than not, the action had already been set in motion before we even stood in front of the team. That way, the announcement wasn’t hype—it was a report of something already happening.

This approach shifted the tone of our meetings. Instead of wondering, “Is this really true?” our people knew they were getting the facts. They could trust that what was said out loud matched what they were experiencing day to day. And when there were hard truths to share, like financial setbacks or client struggles, the same rule applied. Tell the truth, back it with proof, and refuse the kind of comfortable language that leaves teams confused or suspicious.

I’ve learned over time that transparency doesn’t weaken a leader’s position—it strengthens it. When your people see you bringing facts into the light, even when those facts are uncomfortable, they respect you more. They can handle hard realities if they know you’re not hiding them. What they can’t handle is a leader who tries to spin reality into something it isn’t. Unfortunately, this is embedded deeply into business culture these days. Spin where truth needs to stand strong. “Everything is great!”, when it’s visibly not.

For us, this practice built stability. It reinforced that meetings weren’t just talk sessions—they were checkpoints where leadership connected words with evidence. And over time, that consistency built trust. People didn’t have to wait and see if leadership was serious. They already knew.

## Takeaway — Everyday Proof Builds Trust

Looking back over more than three decades of leading, I can say this with certainty: leadership isn’t measured in slogans or speeches. It’s measured in receipts. Every meeting, every announcement, every promise is a chance to either prove your words with action or drain the trust account a little further.

The good news: credibility isn’t built on rare heroics—it’s forged in the ordinary rhythm of doing what you said you would do. Our people didn’t trust me because I gave great speeches. They trusted me because if I said we cared, they could point to MWI Cares or the crying couch as proof. If I said their growth mattered, they had 20% of their week to show it—and the results to back it up. If I said their financial future was important, they saw real dollars in paychecks, benefits, and investments. If I said we were making progress as a company, they could see the numbers for themselves.

This is what separates rhetoric from reality. Leaders who rely on words alone may hold authority, but they don’t hold trust. Authority can demand compliance, but only visible leadership earns willing followers.

And that’s the key: leadership is visible. It’s felt in the way a team works together, in the clarity of updates, in the weight of systems and structures that align with what’s been promised. When actions and words are consistent, trust compounds. When they’re not, trust erodes faster than most leaders realize.

I tell small and mid-sized business leaders this all the time: your people aren’t waiting for you to give the perfect speech. They’re waiting to see if your words line up with what you do next. That’s why the first fundamental of servant leadership is so simple, but so demanding: do the work.

Talk less. Prove more. Build credibility in receipts, not rhetoric. If you do, you’ll find that people don’t just listen to you—they follow you.
