Chapter 21 — The Shield & the Mirror

Theology

Why this matters

Leadership asks two things at once: stand between harm and the people who rely on you, and be honest about whether you can still stand there. The first is the shield—an outward act of protection, standard enforcement, and public defense. The second is the mirror—an inward act of scrutiny, ownership, and a willingness to step back when capacity runs out. Both are required. One without the other becomes martyrdom or desertion.

Harvard Business Review’s 2023 global leadership resilience study tracked 2,700 senior leaders over two years and found that those who practiced “dual accountability”—balancing personal reflection with external advocacy—retained their teams at a rate 47 percent higher than those who focused only on performance protection. The research confirmed what most frontline leaders already sense: the moment the shield never meets the mirror, burnout follows.

Protection without reflection becomes pride. Reflection without protection becomes paralysis. Servant leadership stands in the tension between both—anchored, transparent, human.

Pocket rule: A leader’s first shield is honesty about their own limits.

This isn’t theory. It’s operational. The shield creates the safe field where people can do the work without being ground down by noise, politics, or petty cruelty. The mirror keeps leaders from turning that defense into self-destructive pride. A steward who cannot see their limits destroys both himself and the thing he intended to protect.

Gallup’s 2023 Workplace Resilience Index surveyed more than 15,000 managers across 36 countries and found that teams whose leaders explicitly state personal capacity and model boundary-setting report 44 percent lower burnout and 29 percent higher sustained performance over twelve months. The research echoed what this section names as stewardship: protection that scales only when limits are known.

Capacity isn’t a confession of weakness; it’s an operating standard. When leaders normalize that truth, accountability stops feeling punitive and starts feeling shared.

Pocket rule: Model limits before the work models you.

Put plainly: culture dies when leaders refuse to protect it; culture also dies when leaders keep protecting it at the cost of their health, judgment, and moral authority. Servant leadership is the practical work of managing that tension: enforce standards, protect dignity, and keep checking whether you can reasonably carry the load. If you can’t, the humane—strategic—move is to slow, delegate, or rebuild the shield with others.

Harvard Business Review’s 2023 Adaptive Leadership Under Pressure report found that organizations where leaders share protective responsibility—through delegation, peer guardians, or distributed authority—maintain operational stability 37 percent longer during crises than those centered on a single “heroic” leader. The findings reinforce what this section teaches: sustainability is a team function, not an individual virtue.

Sacrifice, when planned and distributed, multiplies strength. When hoarded, it drains the very culture it was meant to save.

Pocket rule: Shared shields don’t crack as easily.

Stories

The Mirror

In 2021 a nurse practitioner pulled my wife aside, with my permission, and said, “Look.” He laid my labs on the table. They weren’t borderline. They were objectively bad. If health could be read like a calendar, he pointed to the day my body would fail if nothing changed.

That was not a cinematic conversion. It was a factual, clinical alarm. For years I had lived like the bottle behind me was endless. The gym, the software work, the church obligations, family—I had treated all of it as fires I could always put out. The labs were a blunt instrument that proved otherwise.

That mirror moment forced a reframing. Stewardship isn’t only about taking on more for people you love. It is also about staying able to hold the center over time. If the steward collapses, the center collapses with him. From that day I began measuring every big ask against a single question: can I physically and mentally hold what I’m about to take on? If the honest answer was no, the right moves were delegation, a pause, or exit. That was not surrender; it was triage.

A 2022 MIT Sloan Management Review longitudinal study on executive burnout found that leaders who instituted capacity audits—scheduled reviews of workload, energy, and recovery—reduced leadership turnover by 42 percent and improved team performance scores by 18 percent within a year. The reason was simple: when the center holds, everything around it steadies.

Longevity isn’t luck; it’s measured stewardship. A healthy leader sustains the mission longer than a heroic one ever could.

Pocket rule: Rest is the discipline that protects purpose.

I should be clear: knowing the answer and living it are different things. The clarity I gained in that clinic didn’t become practice overnight—I lived with the idea for years before it truly landed. It took until January of 2025 for me to fully accept what the labs had meant. I was buried in the mess. Don’t be like me: having a diagnosis doesn’t automatically change habits.

That mirror also changed how I thought about public defense. If I was going to step into the gap for others, I had to be sure I would still be able to stand there later. That meant choosing fights with more strategy—what I would take on, what I would hand off, and what I would contain with policy rather than personal energy. Leadership longevity is tactical, not romantic.

The shield

When the gym teetered toward failure, stepping in to protect it was not heroic theater. It was service. It wasn’t my dream; it was a friend’s. But the coaches, the members, the neighborhood—those people needed that place to exist. So I chose to stand between the threat and them.

That season was a composite of the ordinary, costly things a shield does. We covered payroll shortfalls. We fixed vendor tangles. I answered member texts at odd hours and showed up to classes when coaches couldn’t. We backed coaches in public and handled the corrective work privately. Those thousand small actions—show up, answer the call, stand in the doorway—kept the room alive long enough for better systems to begin to take root.

Protection meant accepting visible cost. It meant taking blame, absorbing friction, and accepting that preserving dignity in the moment sometimes makes you unpopular elsewhere. It meant enforcing standards evenly, even when doing so was the harder path politically. When public blow-ups threatened the space, we shut down the noise, addressed the issue directly with those involved, and then returned to the floor to restate the standard. Quiet correction, loud support—that rhythm stabilized the room.

The cost was real and compound. There was the immediate financial cost—stabilizing payroll, stepping in to cover shortfalls, and occasionally fronting vendor or repair expenses to keep the doors open. There was the relational cost—missed family dinners, delayed vacations, and the strain on daily rhythms for Carie and the kids. There was the health cost—sleep lost and stress compounded on a body that was already compromised. And there was the opportunity cost—time and money diverted from other initiatives that might have grown our work without the same degree of personal exposure.

All of those costs required hard accounting. Not in a spreadsheet for the reader, but in reality: how long could we keep absorbing before the shield itself broke? That’s the question leaders rarely like to answer, but it’s the most strategic one you’ll face when protection is required.

Deloitte’s 2023 Human Capital Trends report found that leaders who performed regular “capacity audits” of time, budget, and well-being were 2.4 times more likely to sustain organizational trust through financial stress and 30 percent more likely to meet strategic goals on schedule. The lesson was simple: tracking costs isn’t about numbers—it’s about truth. When leaders face the math honestly, they make decisions that preserve both people and mission.

Servant leadership doesn’t hide the bill; it pays it openly so others learn what the work really costs.

Pocket rule: Unmeasured costs become unintended losses.

This was a callback to the mirror. The labs from 2021 didn’t vanish; they were part of every decision I made while defending the place in 2023. The shield and the mirror had to coexist; otherwise the work failed in one direction or the other. That is the hard mechanical work of stewardship—enacting protection while managing capacity.

Takeaways

Where posture becomes practice — lessons learned the hard way

These are not elegant mandates. They are blunt, tactical moves I learned by failing first and fixing later. I include them here so you can skip some of the bruises.

State your capacity explicitly. If you plan to shield, tell people what you can and cannot carry. Limits remove guesswork and resentment. Example lines that worked for us: “I will handle vendor disputes and payroll triage; I will not own day-to-day class schedules.” Saying that didn’t eliminate work; it removed the resentment and clarified who had authority to act.

Defend publicly; correct privately. Stand with your people in front of the room—restate the standard and remove immediate heat. Do the corrective work behind closed doors so the person keeps dignity. The effect is immediate: a coach feels supported; the room calms; the problem gets solved with less collateral damage.

Raise and protect deputies. A shield that cannot be shared is brittle. Identify people who can be trained to stand where you stand. In Carthage, pivoting programming and operations to Brock was one of those moves: it moved responsibility to someone who could carry day-to-day presence more sustainably. Promote people into the shield, then protect them when they take heat. That protection is often the leader’s most valuable work.

Make repair direct, not theatrical. When you miss or withdraw trust, fix it plainly. Name the miss. Apologize where required. Change the process that allowed it. We found that short, honest repairs deposited more credibility than grand public mea culpas. Repair needs to restore function, not earn applause.

Triage your fights. Not every problem deserves your shield. Ask whether the issue is systemic, relational, or performative. If systemic, fix the system. If relational, counsel and repair. If performative, contain and move on. Save steward energy for the fights that truly protect people.

Track the cost. Every act of protection has a cost. Track the human cost (sleep, family strain), the financial cost (out-of-pocket support), and the reputational cost (taking blame publicly). That tracking is less about metrics and more about honest limits—how many nights of sleep can you trade before the product of your leadership is damaged?

Lean on counsel and accountability. When the mess becomes personal and legal, lean on counsel and on the board you’ve assembled for accountability—not for theater but for honest perspective. In our case, counsel engagement (October 2023) and the legal separation process (completed November 1, 2023) were crucial structural steps that allowed the stewardship work to continue without becoming entangled in personal drama. Accountability bodies are not ceremonial; they are lifeboats when the water gets rough.

Don’t romanticize sacrifice. Sacrifice has to be strategic. Sacrificial stories make good speeches. Sustained sacrifice without strategy makes good obituaries. Sacrifice that’s planned, measured, and shared is sustainable. Sacrifice that’s romanticized and solitary is not.

Pocket Rules and Practical Moves

Steward your capacity — you can only protect what you can still hold.

Defend people publicly; correct privately. Preserve dignity; reduce collateral damage.

Say your limits out loud. When others know what you’ll carry, they can carry the rest.

Raise and protect deputies. Elevate people who can stand in the gap; shield them when they do.

Make repair real, not performative. Own the miss; fix the process; move forward.

Triage your fights. Conserve steward energy for battles that matter.

Lean on counsel and board accountability when the conflict is structural. Use them to keep personal politics from becoming the operator of your decision-making.

Final word — The Long View

The shield without the mirror becomes an obituary. The mirror without the shield becomes paralysis. The work is ordinary and costly—made of thousands of small decisions that add up to safety or collapse.

If you intend to be a steward, learn two things well: how to stand in the gap so people have a place to do their work, and how to read your own capacity honestly so you can do that work tomorrow as well as today. Protect people, but protect yourself enough so the protection can last.

This chapter grew out of mistakes I made and then fixed. Take these moves as repairs that actually worked—not theory, not slogans. Learn from the failure I lived through so you don’t have to learn by the same bruises.
