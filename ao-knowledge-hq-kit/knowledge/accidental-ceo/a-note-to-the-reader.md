Hi there. Before we dive in, I want to let you in on something: this isn’t your typical leadership manual.

In fact, calling me a “leader” back when I started would have been a stretch – and that’s exactly why I’m writing this. I stumbled, fumbled, and basically tripped my way into becoming a CEO. Consider this book a personal, honest journey rather than a polished handbook. I’ll share the good decisions, the bad ones, and the downright ridiculous ones.

Why? Because I wish someone had told me these stories when I was a few steps behind where I am now.

If you’re looking for bullet-point perfection, you might be in the wrong place. But if you don’t mind a little self-deprecating humor and some painfully honest moments, I think you’ll find something valuable here. Whether you’re running a company, leading a team, or just trying to figure out what’s next—this book is about the messy, meaningful process of becoming someone worth following.

Let’s start at the beginning… or, at least, my beginning.
