Chapter 9 — The Bridge

Silence on Purpose

From late July until late October of 2023, I couldn’t even step into the gym I owned seventy-five percent of. I wasn’t welcome, but I was still locked in on the goal. Attorneys carried the communication. My job was to stay disciplined and let the process play out.

So I went quiet on purpose. I dug deeper into the numbers. I listened when people came with questions and concerns, but I only answered what I could confirm. Anything else, I left alone. Silence wasn’t withdrawal—it was stewardship. It was giving the process time to do its work without adding more sparks.

Behind the scenes, I kept preparing. Dissolution was coming, I was going to be ready the moment it was complete. Quiet work. Careful listening. No noise. Not everything deserves your voice, especially when your voice is what the room is watching.

Taking the Weight

In November 2023, the separation completed and I became the sole owner of both gyms. Walking in felt like moving into a house that had already burned—someone still needed to live there. We’d been losing eight to ten thousand dollars a month since mid-2022. Carie and I had been covering the gap to keep the doors open. Now the weight sat squarely on me.

Day one wasn’t a speech; it was a sweep. I walked the floor, and touched the details that tell the truth—scuffed plyo boxes, a whiteboard with three different handwriting styles, a stack of rubber plates still warm from the morning class. The heaters hummed; the room felt tired. I pulled a rower out of a traffic lane, reset the chalk bucket where people actually grip, checked the bike batteries, and tossed two cracked 35 pound plates. None of that wins a marketing award. It tells a room, “someone’s paying attention again.”

Carthage was steadier; Brock led it well. Joplin was thin—membership down, trust thin, a gravitational pull toward “elite” that made ordinary members feel like renters. I didn’t broadcast a turnaround plan. I reset the center: members first, coaches second, me last. Simple doesn’t mean easy; it means no excuses.

The first thirty days were about oxygen. Fix the air the room breathes: predictable class times, a warm-up that prepares rather than fills, coaches backed in public so the floor feels safe. The next thirty days were about friction. Move what people trip over—literally and culturally. The third thirty days were about stamina. Can we keep this cadence without flaring out? If servant leadership works, it should scale to Tuesday at 3 p.m., not just launch days and announcements.

I converted the office into a lounge. Not décor—a message. No throne room. No closed door pretending to be access. If I had administrative work, I did it off-site. In the building my job was presence: shake hands, learn names, spot friction before it turns into fallout, listen more than I speak. Presence isn’t a mood; it’s policy. It says, you matter more than my calendar.

Resetting the Center

Transparency hadn’t been the norm. People learned in the dark and repeated what they didn’t know. I flipped it. Early on I wrote often—not-so-short notes to members about what was changing, why, and what they could count on; quick messages to coaches about expectations and support. I wasn’t trying to win an argument. I was building trust. Questions went up at first, and rumor volume went down. Clarity does that.

I asked a handful of men I trust to hold me to the mission. No standing meetings. On-demand by text and email—short, direct, honest. This Board’s job wasn’t to run the business; it was to keep me inside guardrails when compromise looked clever. If a decision was major, I brought them in. That isn’t weakness. It’s how you keep leadership from drifting into self service.

Repair shows up in small signals before it shows up in numbers. Fewer flare-ups at the whiteboard. Direct Messages that ask, “Can we talk?” instead of “I’m done.” A new member who lingers after class because the coach remembered their kid’s name. A veteran who quietly helps a first-timer with a collar and then fades back into the group. No hashtags. Just health.

I kept my own rhythms honest. The redline I’d lived at since 2021 didn’t vanish just because I held new responsibilities. I began training four to six days a week, Carie was helping me eat better, opened Scripture before inboxes, and slept like I wanted to keep this body. None of that was performance. It was stewardship. Exhausted leaders make expensive mistakes.

Culture heals faster when you stop feeding its villains. I refused to write a villain story. No casting. No audience. Repair over theater. That meant shutting down public crossfire and taking hard conversations to quiet rooms. Defend a leader in public; disagree in private. Reward trust, not volume.

Standards on the Floor

Our coaches already knew how to coach. I didn’t need to script progressions or argue rep schemes. My part was the standard and the environment.

The whiteboard is presented as the best opportunity of the day—no side commentary or live undercutting. If there’s disagreement, we handle it offline like adults. The coach owns the floor during class. Class comes first—even when someone’s training solo nearby. Respect for the room is shared. Coaches manage the flow and the noise, and members match that respect. During the briefing, setups pause or stay quiet—no clanging plates, no bar drops—and open-gym athletes and coaches go silent while the coach communicates.

That sounded simple on paper and complex in practice. We were unwinding learned habits: setting up personal equipment during the brief because “that’s how we’ve always done it,” dropping plates covered up important communication, whispered side coaching during someone else’s hour, open-gym workouts that bled into class time. None of this was malicious. It was entropy. Setting new standards is how you reverse it.

This matters beyond a gym. In any business, there’s a “floor”—the moment where your customer faces your craft. In that moment, the professional owns the environment. You can’t deliver clarity to the people you serve if the room won’t hold still long enough for them to hear. Respect for the room is respect for the person you’re serving.

Team over talent was the next layer. The hat you wear inside the gym is coach, not competitor. Present one plan in public; bring disagreement to the table, not the floor. Some embraced that; some didn’t. When local collaboration on programming stalled, I tested a third-party plan. It looked great on paper and landed wrong for our people. I put programming back with the steward whose work matched our values and served the whole room. Sometimes the path to change proves change wasn’t necessary.

Price Follows Service

The decision I dreaded most was price. For years, our rates lagged what the market would bear. We had room to increase. The question wasn’t “can we,” it was “should we, and when.” My answer stays the same: price follows service. It comes last, after value is visible in the room.

I took the question to the board that holds me to the mission. We didn’t argue feelings. We walked the logic like adults—service first, price last, access protected. They pushed where I was soft and trimmed where I was sentimental. We kept a scholarship lane, invited local sponsorships, tightened the member note, and set a review date so the decision wouldn’t be “set and forget.” Guardrails, not theater.

We rolled it out with notice and with help, not surprise and spin. I owned the decision. I owned the timing. I owned the promise behind it: if we ask more, we deliver more. And if someone needed a bridge, we would build one. Price is not a trophy. It’s a tool.

Progress didn’t look like a victory lap. It looked like steadier classes, fewer rumor-fueled blowups, faster answers, and less whiplash. First-timers didn’t feel like intruders. Veterans didn’t feel like babysitters. Programming conversations settled because identity settled first. We were still carrying cost. We were still cleaning up after decisions that predated my return. Fine. Cost wasn’t the measure. Integrity was. Do the next right thing at the right pace with the right guardrails, and keep showing up when you’re tired.

The Handoff

In late October 2024, Carie and I sat with our financial advisor. The cash burn was crushing our future. We made a simple, hard call: eight more months. If the business didn’t turn by then, we would sell or shut it down.

In early November 2024, a message landed from Mica, who owned another gym in town: would we consider selling? I wasn’t ready, but it read like an answer to a quiet prayer. I brought it to the board. They agreed—unanimously. We started negotiations. They ran through March 2025. It wasn’t easy. There were influences that made it more complicated than it needed to be. We stayed with the process and finished.

By early 2025 it was clear I wasn’t rebuilding to stay. Months earlier, Carie and I had already decided to give the gym eight more months to turn around before we’d have to sell or shut down. I was building a bridge. My job wasn’t to prove I could hold the reins forever; it was to deliver something survivable to the next steward.

One Thursday in January, the gym was quiet—the kind of quiet that lets truth surface. The sale terms were mapped. I walked the perimeter one more time like a landlord checking outlets—rig bolts tight, rowers straight, med balls where a new member wouldn’t feel in the way. No music. No audience. I wasn’t rehearsing a goodbye; I was finishing a promise.

The sale finalized in March 2025. No confetti. No speech. I signed, shook hands, and walked to the door. I was tired. I was at peace—the kind of peace you get when you keep promises other people can’t verify but you. We protected the center. We reset standards. We told the truth early. We used process over performance. We priced last, and only after service led. We refused to feed the drama. We finished with dignity and ended with clarity.

Bridges don’t get spotlights. They get people safely across. That’s enough.
