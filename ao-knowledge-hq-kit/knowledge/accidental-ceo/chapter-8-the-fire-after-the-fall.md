The Turning Point

December 2022 brought more loss.

Within six months, I had been forced to let go of one company I built and then found myself holding the full weight of another. First MWI slipped from my hands. Then MWB shifted entirely onto my shoulders.

The circumstances didn’t matter as much as the reality: if Midwestern Built was going to survive, it was up to me. There was no backup plan, no one else to steady the load. The business was bleeding money, and the culture wasn’t fragile — it was broken into a thousand pieces.

So I did what I had always done: I stepped in. I shouldered the weight no one else was willing to carry. Not because it was easy. Not because it made financial sense. But because there were members and coaches who deserved a place worth fighting for.

There is a moment in every crisis when you watch the exit door swing open and decide to stay anyway. For me, that moment didn’t happen in a boardroom. It happened on an ordinary weekday, standing by the whiteboard as classes changed over. A mom who had been away for months walked back in, nervous and quiet. A retiree taped his wrist and smiled like he was home. A young guy asked for the bar with less knurling because his hands tore easily. No speeches. Just people choosing to keep going. I could leave. Or I could stand where I said I would.

Pocket rule: Servant leadership doesn’t fixate on what’s gone — it protects what remains.

Survival Mode

The math was brutal. From July of 2022 until March of 2025, we were losing between eight and ten thousand dollars every month. Thirty-four months in a row. I know because I wrote the check.

This wasn’t an abstract number on a spreadsheet. It was money pulled directly from my personal reserves, poured into keeping the gym alive. Payroll. Mortgage. Utilities. Insurance. Every line item demanded cash, and there was no “pause” button. The gym had to run, even when the numbers screamed otherwise. When equipment failed, it wasn’t a theoretical expense — it was an immediate decision between repair now or bigger problems later. When a vendor bill hit, it didn’t care how tired I was. When insurance renewed, it didn’t check our feelings about the last quarter.

Every month felt like stepping into a ring, knowing I’d get hit, hoping I’d still be standing when the bell rang. And then doing it all over again thirty-three more times. That isn’t drama. It’s arithmetic.

Carie carried it with me. I worked the math with our accountant, bookkeeper, and investment advisor—line by line, month after month. The checks still came from us, but the decisions were made with counsel and data, not late-night panic. We cut what didn’t serve the mission. We paid what protected people. We delayed what could wait without hurting members or staff. It was unglamorous stewardship — no ribbon-cuttings, no “look at us” posts. Just choices that kept the floor safe and the doors open.

There was also a necessary stop-gap I had to end. A monthly “guaranteed payment” had been baked into expectations. Maybe that made sense once. In a business running this far in the red, it made no sense at all. A company cannot guarantee distributions it cannot afford. Ending it wasn’t aggression. It was owning the responsibility.

Pocket rule: A leader’s sacrifice is invisible until the checks stop clearing.

It would have been easier to walk away, to let the business collapse under its own weight. But walking away would have meant more than losing money. It would have meant abandoning people. And that I could not do.

Cultural Defense

From the beginning, my vision for Midwestern Built was never just about fitness. It was about people. It was about creating a place where anyone — any age, gender, fitness level, or background — could belong and succeed.

But in that season, the vision that had driven us from the start felt buried under the sheer weight of strain. Conversations about the state of the business were strained and scattered, often shaped more by the pressure of the moment than by the clarity we all needed. In times of pressure, any organization can drift toward metrics, urgency, and survival mode—treating members as numbers, coaches as operators, and culture as something that can be rebuilt later. The danger is that even well-intentioned teams can slip into that pattern without noticing. For a stretch of time, that was the current we were trying to fight our way through.

I couldn’t let that happen.

So I showed up every day, not just to pay the bills, but to protect the soul of the gym. The strain of the season had created currents that pulled people in different directions, and my work was to steady the middle. I focused on supporting coaches when the pressure around us made the room feel heavy. I fought to preserve an environment where members didn’t just come to work out, but to heal, grow, and belong.

Basic things mattered again: classes starting on time; warm-ups that prepared people, not just filled minutes; whiteboard briefs that sounded like an invitation, not a test. It wasn’t glamorous leadership. There were no press releases, no applause. It was daily defense. It was absorbing blows so others didn’t have to.

I also changed the way we communicated. By the time I stepped into full responsibility, communication had become fragmented and people were filling gaps with whatever information they could find. I corrected that. In those first months I wrote often — emails to members, notes on social channels — short and direct: what was changing, why it was changing, and what people could count on. I wasn’t trying to win an argument. I was building trust. Questions went up at first, as they should. But the volume of rumor went down. Clarity does that.

And I kept the center in view — the middle of the room where everyone lives. Progress was small and ordinary: people returning after setbacks, relearning movements, and showing up when life was heavy. No highlight reel—just steady work. That was the point.

Pocket rule: Protect the culture, even when it costs you personally.

The Personal Toll

Protection came at a price.

My health had already been in decline during the last years at MWI. Stress, poor sleep, and constant sacrifice took their toll. By the time I stepped into MWB full-time, my tank was already empty. The weight of the financial bleed, the dysfunction, and the cultural defense pushed me even further. Nights grew shorter. Blood pressure climbed. My body protested in ways I couldn’t ignore.

Leadership at that point wasn’t inspiring or energizing. It was survival. I showed up because I had to, not because I felt strong enough to. That kind of honesty isn’t heroic. It’s necessary. You can pretend your capacity is infinite, but your body will correct you.

I started listening. The doctor told me to throttle back. The counselor handed me practical tools: slow the inputs; take walks before screens; lift four to six days a week; eat like you want to keep the body God gave you; write down what you’re carrying so it doesn’t own your head. None of that was performance. It was stewardship. Exhausted leaders make expensive mistakes.

So I acted like I believed it. Simple meals. Earlier nights. Scripture open before inboxes. Walks without a phone. Short workouts that didn’t require adrenaline to count. Not dramatic. Sustainable. My resting heart rate started to drift down. The edges of my patience came back. I wasn’t “better.” I was at least pointed in the right direction.

There’s a difference between the kind of fire that refines and the kind that consumes. For much of my career, the fire had refined me. It had sharpened resilience, clarified convictions, and forged leadership. But here, the fire wanted to consume. The only way through was to lower the flames — not by quitting, but by refusing to feed them.

Pocket rule: Servant leadership doesn’t guarantee health for the leader. Sometimes it demands it.

Fighting Back

I’ve always led by giving people the benefit of the doubt. That reflex — assume the best, extend grace, trust first — didn’t change. But inside the gym, that grace was misread as weakness.

In a meeting with several witnesses, I heard the statement, ‘You got yours. Now I’m getting mine.’ In that moment, I wasn’t seen as a colleague or teammate — I was reduced to a bank. I was already covering losses, already financing survival, and now I was expected to fund his climb to the next opportunity as well. That’s the opposite of servant leadership. A servant leader doesn’t take from the mission when it’s bleeding; they protect the whole so the people inside it can survive. When the rest of the team gets theirs, ours follows.

Staying servant-led didn’t mean passivity. It meant stewardship with a spine: no guaranteed payouts while the business bled; no terms that put an individual ahead of the mission; no decisions that rewarded ego at the expense of the room. I gathered proofs, moved through process, and acted — not for ego or control, but for the people the gym existed to serve.

There were days it felt like I was wasting breath. Then a small signal would show up — a class that ran clean, a coach who felt backed even when we disagreed privately, a member who stayed after to say, “this feels like it used to.” Those were markers on the trail. Not victory laps. Directional signs.

Pocket rule: Servant leaders carry towels, not doormats.

Lineage callout: This was Greenleaf’s stewardship in practice — protecting both mission and people, even when it cost me.

The Handoff

By October 2023, the other side had engaged counsel. I retained counsel I trusted, chose silence as discipline, and kept showing up. Stewardship, not spectacle. Negotiations surfaced priorities you can’t see until process forces them into daylight. We would carry the fire only as long as it protected people — and then we would pass it with dignity.

I didn’t need to be the closer. I needed to be faithful. That meant finishing the part of the work that still belonged to me, and refusing to grab what didn’t.

The months that followed were heavy but clear. The bridge had to be built before it could be crossed.

The next chapter tells how we crossed that bridge.
