Chapter 14: Clarity Beats Chaos

Theology

Communication as a Form of Service

Leadership often rises or falls on a single factor: clarity. Chaos thrives in the absence of it. When communication is vague, contradictory, or overloaded with noise, trust erodes and teams stumble. When clarity is present, people find their footing, even in the hardest seasons.

This isn’t about eloquence or speechmaking. I’ve seen leaders light up a room with energy, convinced they’ve delivered the most inspiring talk of their lives, while their people leave confused, frustrated, or worse—disconnected. I’ve also been that leader. I’ve stood at the front of the room, poured out vision and strategy, only to realize later that I had added more weight than direction. That’s why I believe clarity isn’t just a communication skill—it’s an act of service.

Gallup’s latest U.S. workplace readout underscores that point: only 46% of employees strongly agree they know what’s expected of them at work, down ten points from the March 2020 high. When people don’t have clear expectations, they disengage, hesitate, and start looking elsewhere. Clarity isn’t motivational fluff—it’s oxygen. Name the target. Define the win. Show how work gets measured. When that happens, teams stop guessing and start moving.

Pocket rule: Say the quiet parts early—expectations, owners, and deadlines.

Story

The Year-End Meeting That Missed the Mark

One memory stands out in particular. It was a year-end meeting—one of those moments where you gather the whole team, recap the wins, celebrate the people who made it happen, and then cast vision for the future. On paper, it should have been a great day. And in many ways, it was.

We were in a building we had just bought, but it was anything but new. At least fifty years old, it had been used as an industrial or commercial warehouse, and it showed. The place was dark, dirty, and covered in the kind of grease and grime that clings to everything. It looked more like the set of a slasher movie than the headquarters of a fast-growing software company. Only a dreamer could have seen the potential in that space. And our people weren’t in the mood for dreaming. They were tired. They had been pressed hard to keep pace with years of 80% growth, and the fatigue was showing.

Still, we did the show. We walked through another year of incredible results. We celebrated wins. We gave credit where it was due. And then we turned the conversation toward the future. That’s where things went sideways. What I thought would be motivating—casting vision for what was next—landed like more weight on their shoulders. Instead of relief, we handed them more pressure. Instead of stability, we gave them another speech about progress.

Don’t get me wrong—the sky wasn’t falling. Nobody was ready to revolt. But it was clear we hadn’t read the room. What our people needed in that moment wasn’t more fuel. They needed relief. They needed clarity that stability mattered as much as growth.

I left that meeting knowing we had dropped the ball as a leadership team. The vision wasn’t the problem—the timing and the tone were. Without a lot of pomp or fanfare, I went back to the people I was directly leading. I owned what had happened. I tried to put out the fires my own words had lit. And I recommitted to making sure progress wouldn’t be pursued “at all costs.”

That day reminded me of a truth I wish more leaders would embrace: clarity isn’t about saying more. It’s about saying what’s needed, in a way your people can carry.

Takeaways

Scaling Lens — Clarity Changes with Size

Clarity is important in any organization, but how it plays out shifts as the company grows. A leader of ten doesn’t communicate the same way as a leader of 250. The need for clarity is constant, but the structures and rhythms change.

In a company of 10, clarity is personal. Everyone hears things directly from the owner or manager. You can gather the team in a single room—or around a single table—and know the message landed. Miscommunication still happens, but it’s usually a matter of assumptions or distractions, not breakdowns in the system.

By 50 people, you can’t assume everyone hears it firsthand. You’re now depending on middle managers, project leads, or informal culture carriers to translate what leadership says. If you don’t give them clarity, they’ll fill the gaps themselves, and the message will come out twisted. This is where “telephone game” leadership starts showing up.

At 104 employees, I learned this lesson the hard way. By then, clarity wasn’t optional—it had to be built into every layer of the business. Communication was no longer just what you said in meetings—it was what you documented, what you repeated, and what you reinforced. People weren’t looking for more words; they were looking for alignment. And when they didn’t get it, the cracks showed.

That’s exactly what happened. One leader was saying “growth at all costs,” while I was saying “stability first.” The two visions collided, and chaos took root. Employees didn’t know which message to follow. If metrics and updates didn’t match the speeches, trust eroded even further. That difference in both vision and approach is, in many ways, the single biggest factor in why I’m writing this book today instead of still leading in that business.

At 150 people, the principle only intensifies. Anthropologist Robin Dunbar suggested that humans can only hold about 150 stable relationships at once. Whether or not you buy the exact number, the principle is true—beyond a certain point, leaders can’t rely on personal connection alone. You need clear systems. Rituals. Rhythms that carry the message when you can’t.

At 250, clarity has to be systematized into every part of the business. Communication at that scale is less about eloquence and more about consistency. If one team hears one thing while another team hears something else, you’ve planted the seeds of chaos.

Research supports this shift.

McKinsey’s Organizational Health Index tracks how well companies align direction, coordinate work, and reinforce norms—clarity by other names. In longitudinal analyses, public companies in the top quartile of organizational health delivered roughly 3× the total shareholder returns of bottom-quartile peers. Translation: when priorities, roles, and rhythms are unambiguous, performance compounds. Health isn’t vibes—it’s execution at scale: the same message in every room, the same rules on every team, the same guardrails under pressure.

Pocket rule: One message, many rooms—repeat it until it’s boring.

Gallup found that when managers provide consistent, clear expectations, employee engagement can jump by as much as 23%. But when expectations are unclear or conflicting, stress spikes, productivity plummets, and turnover rises. Harvard Business Review has shown that alignment around priorities is one of the strongest predictors of performance in scaling companies.

The takeaway is simple: clarity always matters, but the larger your company grows, the more you have to systematize it. In small companies, you can lean on relationships. In bigger ones, you need both relationships and repeatable structures. Either way, the leader’s role doesn’t change—you are the chief clarity officer.

Contrast — Leaders Who Muddle vs. Leaders Who Clarify

The difference between muddled leadership and clear leadership shows up fast. I’ve seen both sides—sometimes in the same room.

Muddled leadership feels like a fog rolling in. Words pile up, but no one knows what to do next. Leaders leave meetings thinking they’ve inspired, while the team walks out asking, “So…what now?” Instructions contradict each other. Priorities shift week to week. Employees spend as much energy trying to interpret the message as they do carrying it out. Chaos doesn’t need a villain to thrive—confusion will do the job all by itself.

Clear leadership, on the other hand, feels like a light in the fog. It doesn’t mean every detail is figured out or every problem is solved. But it does mean people walk away knowing where they stand, what matters most, and what’s expected of them. Clarity doesn’t eliminate hard work—it makes hard work possible. When people know what to aim for, they can put their energy into execution instead of guessing at direction.

I’ve lived this tension. At our best, we created rhythms of communication that aligned the team and gave them confidence to move forward. At our worst, we left people guessing which version of the story was true. It wasn’t about eloquence. I’ve given eloquent speeches that landed flat, and I’ve given short, simple updates that brought calm and focus. The difference was clarity.

Research echoes this. A McKinsey study found that when employees feel senior leaders communicate effectively, they’re 8x more likely to be engaged. Gallup has shown that lack of clarity around expectations is one of the top drivers of disengagement and burnout. People can tolerate tough assignments, long hours, even mistakes—what they can’t tolerate is confusion.

That’s why clarity isn’t optional. It’s not a luxury for good days—it’s a lifeline in the middle of growth, fatigue, or crisis.
Clarity as Service, Not Speechmaking

Looking back, I see how easy it is for leaders to confuse communication with clarity. Just because you spoke doesn’t mean people understood. Just because you cast vision doesn’t mean your team can carry it. Words without alignment create noise.

Clarity is not about saying more. It’s not about charisma, volume, or the perfect turn of phrase. Clarity is about serving your people by reducing the chaos that already surrounds them. It’s about making sure they know what matters most, what’s expected, and what stability looks like. When leaders provide that, they remove unnecessary weight from their teams’ shoulders.

In my own leadership, I learned this lesson by stumbling through both sides. I’ve stood in front of rooms where I thought I nailed it, only to walk away realizing I had piled pressure on an already exhausted team. I’ve also seen the calm that comes when words are simple, honest, and reinforced by consistent action. Those are the moments when trust deepens and work gets done.

Research makes it clear that clarity is one of the strongest predictors of employee engagement, productivity, and retention.

Decision clarity is where speed comes from. Bain’s decade-long research (1,000+ companies) found a tight correlation—at 95% confidence—between decision effectiveness (quality, speed, yield, effort) and business performance. Their practical push: make roles explicit so there’s no drift about who recommends, who decides, and who executes. When teams know “who has the D,” meetings shrink, cycle times drop, and rework disappears. That’s clarity in motion—less theater, more throughput.

Pocket rule: Name the decider. Kill the drift.

But I didn’t need a study to prove it. I saw it firsthand: when people were given clarity, they thrived. When they were left in chaos, they struggled.

For leaders of small to mid-sized companies—10 to 250 people—the lesson is the same. You are the chief clarity officer. Your role isn’t to impress your team with speeches; it’s to serve them with alignment. Clarity may not always feel flashy, but it’s the foundation that makes every other part of leadership possible.

So don’t confuse communication with clarity. Don’t assume words equal understanding. And don’t wait for chaos to expose the gaps. Choose clarity early, repeat it often, and reinforce it consistently. Your people don’t need more noise—they need light in the fog.
