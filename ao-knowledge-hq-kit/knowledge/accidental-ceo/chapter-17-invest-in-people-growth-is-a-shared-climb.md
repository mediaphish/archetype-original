Chapter 17: Invest in People: Growth Is a Shared Climb

Theology

Investment in People

I believe the way a leader views people determines everything else about how they lead.

Leaders who see people as assets to grow, not resources to spend, create different outcomes entirely.

Gallup’s 2023 State of the Global Workplace found that teams who feel their growth is actively encouraged are 3.6 times more engaged and twice as likely to stay beyond three years. Development isn’t a luxury—it’s the first sign of genuine respect. When people sense you’re investing in their future, they start investing in yours.

Pocket rule: Respect and retention share the same root.

Some see people as tools—resources to be used up, swapped out, or replaced when they’ve delivered their value. Others see people as roots—sources of life, growth, and stability that, if nurtured, make the entire organization stronger over time.

For me, investment in people has never been optional. It’s not a perk. It’s not a side budget line for when times are good. It is the theology of leadership itself—the conviction that the highest return you’ll ever see isn’t on a product, or a process, or even a market opportunity. The highest return comes when you put your energy, time, and resources into helping people grow.

Bad leaders talk about investment, but what they really mean is extraction.

Harvard Business Review’s 2022 survey of 3,000 managers found that organizations driven by output-only metrics lost top performers 30 percent faster than those that balanced results with growth conversations. Extraction burns bright and dies early; investment burns steady and lights others. People can feel the difference instantly—one drains, the other develops.

Pocket rule: If they leave empty, you never led.

They “invest” in people only as long as it maximizes their own return. A company owner who isn’t building something lasting but polishing the books for a sale price. A leader who designs every system to make sure they win, regardless of the cost to the team that carried them there. A salesman who closes a deal his team can’t possibly deliver. These leaders might call it investment, but it’s not. It’s consumption dressed up as strategy.

And it’s fragile. Businesses like this struggle because they’re built on sand. When people are treated as disposable, culture erodes, loyalty evaporates, and performance becomes transactional at best. What looks efficient in the short term quickly becomes toxic in the long term.

The alternative is harder, but it’s also the only way forward. To invest in people is to see beyond the quarter, beyond the immediate payoff, beyond your own recognition.

Deloitte’s Human Capital Trends 2023 study of 10,000 leaders found that companies prioritizing long-term people development were 1.8× more likely to exceed financial targets and 2.3× more likely to rank in the top quartile for innovation. Long horizons require faith—faith that growing people eventually grows the business. The short game rewards control; the long game rewards belief.

Pocket rule: Play long with people, and they’ll play long with you.

It is to play the long game of leadership: cloning yourself by teaching, guiding, and trusting. It is to willingly work yourself out of a job by raising up people who don’t need you to hold their hand. It is to choose multiplication over maintenance.

This isn’t just philosophy. It’s survival. If you want your business to grow, you have to grow your people. If you want to maximize the value of what you’ve built, you have to stop polishing the surface and start planting deeper roots. Because when your people rise, the business rises with them.

Stories

Cloning Yourself as a Leader

When I think about what it means to invest in people, Ryan comes to mind almost immediately. He was our first real hire after forming Midwestern Interactive. At that point, we didn’t really have a team culture to speak of. He was it. From the moment he walked through the door, Ryan’s heart was for the team—before there even was one.

What I recognized in him was not just skill, but posture. He wanted to build something bigger than himself, and that matched the conviction I carried into every decision: people first, business second. From the very beginning, I invested in Ryan—not with formal lessons or sit-down training sessions, but through real relationship. We worked side by side. He watched how I led, and I gave him space to lead himself. Over the years, he became one of the people I poured into most consistently.

That investment wasn’t a single gesture. It was a decade of consistent presence—leading together, learning together. Everything I had learned about protecting culture, carrying weight, and putting people before profit, I passed on in the daily rhythms of working together. The point wasn’t replacement; it was multiplication—equipping others to lead where I couldn’t. A leader who hoards their knowledge will always be limited to the boundaries of their own energy. A leader who passes it on through relationship can expand their influence far beyond what they could ever accomplish alone.

One of our final conversations before I stepped away is still etched in my memory. Ryan looked at me and said, “I want to carry that torch for you.” In that moment, I realized the investment had come full circle. I had effectively worked myself out of a job—not in title, but in influence. The values I had lived out were now embodied in someone else. That’s the truest measure of leadership: not how much you control, but how much of yourself you’ve multiplied.

It’s worth saying this plainly: bad leaders don’t clone themselves. They keep their teams dependent because it makes them feel powerful. They stay the smartest person in the room, even if it means progress grinds to a halt without them. Servant leaders do the opposite. They walk with people in the trenches. They model values in real time. They invite others into the work, not to make them followers, but to make them leaders.

Ryan’s story is a reminder that when you invest in people deeply, you don’t just grow an employee—you grow a carrier of culture. That torch isn’t just a metaphor. It’s the reality of servant leadership: one life passing fire to another, until the light grows brighter than any one leader could carry alone.

Working Yourself Out of a Job

The hardest truth for many leaders to accept is this: if you do your job well, one day you won’t be needed. That’s not failure. That’s success. Servant leadership isn’t about creating dependence—it’s about creating strength. It’s about building people so capable that the organization no longer rests on your shoulders alone.

When I think back over my years in leadership, some of the most rewarding moments weren’t when I was in the spotlight but when I realized the team could carry weight without me. Watching Ryan carry the torch was one example of that. Another came earlier, when we took a risk on hiring a couple of high school kids—sixteen years old, raw talent, and not much else. From the outside, it didn’t look like much of an investment. But what they lacked in experience, they made up for in drive. One of them in particular never gave up on himself, and that refusal to quit demanded our investment in return.

Those early years with them weren’t glamorous. We were teaching fundamentals while also running a business. But little by little, we walked with them—through deadlines, mistakes, even personal challenges. We weren’t just shaping their work; we were shaping their future. Today, both of them are still in the industry and leading in their own right. That’s the payoff of working yourself out of a job: watching the people you once had to lead begin to lead others.

But here’s the hard part: once the torch is passed, the responsibility also shifts. Some leaders fear that when they’re no longer present to carry the culture of servant leadership, it will fade—and they’re not wrong. I’ve watched things slip in my absence. Servant leaders can only do as much as their own leadership allows. You can plant deeply, you can model faithfully, but you can’t guarantee what happens after you leave. That’s the tough reality every servant leader must face.

Bad leaders try to solve this by clinging to control. They hold onto their role like it’s oxygen, afraid that if someone else steps up, they’ll lose their importance. And in doing so, they ensure that everything crumbles the moment they walk away. Servant leaders take a different path. They risk letting go, knowing the culture might not hold perfectly, but believing it’s still worth investing, still worth passing on. Because the alternative—never raising anyone else—is far worse.
The Boat Metaphor

Growth is often pictured as a ladder, with the leader at the top pulling others up one rung at a time. I’ve never liked that image. It makes leadership feel like a hierarchy—one person higher, everyone else below. To me, growth is more like a boat.

When you invest in the people around you, it doesn’t just raise them individually. It raises the whole boat. Elevating one person creates lift for the entire team. A ship riding higher in the water meets less resistance, handles rough seas better, and sails more efficiently toward the future. That’s what investment does: it reduces drag, increases speed, and gives the whole organization momentum it could never generate if everyone stayed at the same level.

But here’s where the metaphor deepens: leaders have to be very careful with phrases like, “We’re all in the same boat.” Because the truth is, sometimes people fall out of the boat—or get pushed out. Then what? Do you throw them a rope? Do you row on without them? Do you stop and figure out why they went overboard in the first place?

This isn’t theoretical for me. My wife and I lived through it. In a community we loved, surrounded by people we thought were rowing with us, conflict hit hard. Decisions were made, lines were drawn, and before long we found ourselves out of the boat. We weren’t perfect in that season—no one ever is—but we begged for clarity, for accountability, for someone to say what was right and what was wrong. Instead, leadership chose passivity. They didn’t protect the truth. They didn’t call out what needed to be called out. They just let us drift.

That experience left a mark. It taught me that good leaders don’t take the easy way out when conflict arises on the boat. They don’t look away or hope the waves calm down on their own. Servant leadership isn’t about being endlessly agreeable. It’s about setting and holding the standard. It’s about protecting the integrity of the boat and the people in it.

Sometimes people need to be out of the boat—that’s true. A team can’t carry unrepentant toxicity or constant sabotage. But if someone goes overboard unjustly, or if conflict drives good people apart, then the leader’s responsibility is clear: create a path back in. Throw the rope. Call out truth loudly. Help resolve what can be resolved. Because a boat that sheds people through silence and avoidance is a boat destined to sink.

I’ve also seen the opposite. Maritime law has a simple principle: leave no one behind. Twenty years ago, my wife and I were on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. In the middle of the night, we were jolted awake as the ship leaned hard to starboard—something you don’t normally feel on a vessel that size. Later we learned why. The captain had made a decision to turn the entire ship around to rescue a group of Haitians adrift on a failing raft. Thousands of people were inconvenienced. Schedules were disrupted. But none of that mattered, because the priority was clear: no one gets left behind.

That moment stuck with me. It reminded me that leadership is not just about the people comfortably seated on deck. It’s about the ones clinging to the edges, the ones at risk of being lost altogether. Good leaders will always be judged, not by how they treat the strong, but by how they respond to the vulnerable. Sometimes that means slowing down the whole ship. Sometimes that means turning it around entirely. But the message it sends—to those inside and outside the boat—is unforgettable.

Takeaways

Carry it Forward

When I look back over my own journey, what stands out the most isn’t the projects we shipped, the revenue we generated, or the recognition we earned. It’s the people. The teammates who grew into leaders. The young hires who became trusted professionals. The ones who caught the vision of servant leadership and chose to carry it forward. That’s the fruit of investment.

No leader is remembered for how much they extracted. They’re remembered for how much they invested. Titles fade. Balance sheets change. Companies rise and fall. But the lives you elevate—that legacy doesn’t go away. Every hour you give to develop someone, every conversation that sparks confidence, every chance you take on a person who just needs someone to believe in them—all of it adds up to something bigger than yourself.

And here’s the reality: investing in people is never efficient. It takes time you don’t think you have. It takes resources you sometimes feel like you can’t spare. It takes patience when you’d rather just do the work yourself. But it’s the only investment that multiplies. It’s the only one that pays dividends long after you’re gone.

This is why I call it a shared climb. When the people around you rise, so does the organization. When the boat lifts, everyone sails smoother. And when someone falls out, the leader’s role is not to row on in silence but to decide how to respond—whether to pull them back in or hold the line. Servant leadership is not soft leadership. It requires courage, clarity, and conviction.

As we turn to the next fundamental, the focus shifts from investment to refinement. If investing in people is how you help them grow, feedback is how you shape that growth. Servant leaders don’t just hand people resources and walk away—they walk alongside and say the hard things well. Because the climb isn’t just about getting stronger; it’s about getting better.
