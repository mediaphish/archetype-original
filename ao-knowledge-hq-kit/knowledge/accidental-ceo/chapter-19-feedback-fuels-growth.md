Chapter 19: Feedback Fuels Growth — Say the Hard Things Well

Theology

The Hardest Part of Leadership

The hardest thing I’ve ever done as a leader wasn’t carrying the financial risk of payroll. It wasn’t the long hours or even the constant uncertainty of the market. Those things were heavy, but they never matched the weight of looking another human being in the eye and saying, “This isn’t right.”

Correction is the crucible of leadership. If you’re serious about growth, you can’t avoid it. A team that never hears honest feedback will eventually stall out. Mistakes repeat. Blind spots turn into fractures. Frustration grows silently until it poisons the culture. That’s why good leaders never dodge the hard conversations.

Gallup’s 2023 State of the Global Workplace study found that employees who receive meaningful feedback at least weekly are 3.2 times more likely to be engaged and 2.7 times more likely to strongly trust their manager. The same data set showed that lack of feedback ranked among the top three predictors of voluntary turnover.

Feedback isn’t friction; it’s fuel. When people know where they stand, they stop wasting energy guessing. The conversation might sting, but it anchors belonging instead of eroding it.

Pocket rule: Silence kills more progress than conflict ever could.

I didn’t have to sit down for hard conversations every day. In fact, good leadership usually prevents a lot of conflict from ever reaching that point. But when those conversations did come, I didn’t dodge them. Almost every time, I opened with the same line: “This is going to be a hard one.” I didn’t say it for drama. I said it to set the agenda before we ever got into the details. No surprises. No buildup of tension. Just clarity: this was going to be difficult, but it was also going to be honest.

Google’s Re:Work program confirmed that teams with leaders who frame difficult feedback conversations in advance—clarity before criticism—score 35 percent higher in psychological safety and resolve performance issues 60 percent faster. When people know what’s coming, the brain’s threat response drops. They can hear correction as care instead of attack.

Hard truth, named early, preserves dignity on both sides. It tells the other person, “You’re safe here, even when it’s uncomfortable.” That’s leadership under pressure, not performance under spotlight.

Pocket rule: Clarity is kindness under tension.

Feedback, when it’s real, feels like standing in a blacksmith’s forge. The metal doesn’t get stronger without fire and hammering. Sparks fly. The heat is uncomfortable. But the process produces strength that can withstand pressure. Without the forge, the steel stays weak. Without correction, people stay fragile in their blind spots.

A 2022 MIT Sloan study tracking 1,800 managers showed that teams receiving direct, behavior-specific feedback improved measurable output by 19 percent in six months compared with peers relying on annual reviews. The same research found that performance dips only when feedback is vague or delayed.

Precision builds trust. Generalities build confusion. The forge analogy holds: the heat refines, not destroys, when you keep it focused.

Pocket rule: Specific beats soft every time.

It’s also like holding up a mirror. Nobody sees themselves clearly without one. Leaders aren’t punishing when they give feedback — they’re reflecting. They’re offering a view of reality that someone can’t see on their own.

Deloitte’s 2023 Human Capital Trends report found that employees who described post-feedback follow-up from leaders as “consistent and fair” were 4.6 times more likely to report high trust levels six months later. It isn’t the correction that breaks trust; it’s abandonment afterward.

Great leaders circle back. They check progress, reinforce wins, and remind the person why the hard talk happened in the first place — because they matter. That second conversation deposits what the first one withdrew.

Pocket rule: Follow-up is the final word in feedback.

And if you’ve ever been part of sports, you know the point. No athlete in history improved without correction. They don’t just practice; they train. Training means a coach calls out bad form, shows a better way, and demands repetition until it sticks. Work is no different. If we want our people to grow, we have to be willing to coach.

The hardest part of leadership isn’t the spreadsheets or the strategy. It’s choosing to walk into the forge with another person — knowing the sparks will fly, but also believing the strength on the other side is worth it.

Truth as Service, Not a Weapon

Not all feedback builds strength. I’ve seen leaders swing truth like a hammer, determined to crush mistakes and remind everyone who’s in charge. Those conversations don’t produce growth; they produce fear. And fear never creates excellence. At best, it produces compliance — people who do just enough to stay out of trouble but never bring their best selves to the table.

It gets worse when leaders manufacture their own version of truth and wield that instead. I’ve watched leaders invent problems, exaggerate mistakes, or slap unfair labels on people to maintain control. That isn’t correction — it’s abuse. It’s not about building up the person in front of them; it’s about protecting ego or inflating authority. And when people see that kind of behavior, they don’t just lose respect for the leader. They lose trust in the entire system. If truth can be twisted once, it can be twisted again. No one feels safe in a culture like that.

I’ve seen the opposite mistake too — leaders so afraid of conflict that they sugarcoat everything. They soften the message, circle around the issue, or drown it in vague encouragement until the point is lost. That doesn’t create safety; it creates confusion. People deserve clarity, not half-truths dressed up to avoid discomfort.

Servant leadership takes a different path. It pairs truth with care. It delivers clarity without cruelty. It puts the person first and the problem second. When I walked into hard conversations, my goal wasn’t to prove I was right or to defend my authority. My goal was to help us move forward.

That’s why I’ve always preferred to say, “We work together,” instead of, “You work for me.” Some might call it a small thing, but I believe it matters. It reframes the relationship. It levels the ground. When feedback comes from someone who positions themselves as with you instead of over you, trust rises. And when trust is present, even the hardest words can be received as a gift instead of an attack.

Truth, when it’s delivered this way, becomes an act of service. It clears the fog. It calls people up instead of tearing them down. It builds confidence instead of destroying it. It reminds the entire team that leadership isn’t about being right — it’s about doing right by the people you lead.

Stories

Owning Your Part First

I never walked into a correction conversation assuming I was the problem. That wouldn’t have helped anyone. But I did make a habit of asking myself first: Did I contribute to this?

Sometimes the answer was yes. Maybe I hadn’t been clear, maybe priorities were stacked wrong, or maybe I hadn’t given someone the support they needed. Most of the time the responsibility sat primarily with the individual, but I didn’t want to ignore the possibility that leadership had played a role too.

So when I sat down with someone, I tried to leave space for that. I didn’t dramatize it or beat myself up — I just talked like a human. If I had dropped the ball, I admitted it. If I hadn’t, I stayed focused on the issue at hand. The point wasn’t to take blame that didn’t belong to me. The point was to make sure the conversation was about the whole picture, not just one side of it.

What I found is that when leaders show they’re willing to own their part, even in small ways, people become far more willing to own theirs. It shifts the conversation from defensiveness to problem-solving. Instead of a standoff, it becomes a joint effort to fix what went wrong and make it better the next time.

Leaders who can’t do that usually fall into the opposite trap. They come in looking to assign blame, assuming laziness or malice when most of the time it’s just misalignment. They want to win the moment instead of fix the issue. And they end up standing alone, because nobody trusts a leader who always has to be right.

Servant leadership doesn’t assume guilt, but it does allow for humility. It recognizes that leadership can contribute to failure and that owning that part, when it’s real, builds trust. That balance — not groveling, not excusing, but staying honest — is what makes correction safe enough to spark growth.

Grace + Forward Momentum

Correction, by itself, doesn’t accomplish much. If all you do is point out what went wrong, people walk away discouraged, or worse, defensive. Feedback only becomes leadership when it points forward. That’s why almost every hard conversation I had followed the same rhythm: set the agenda, name the problem, and then move quickly into a plan for what comes next.

I knew the pace we were working at. It wasn’t rocket science, but it was close. Deadlines were tight, expectations were high, and the margin for error was small. Chaos came with the territory. In that kind of environment, finger-pointing was useless. What people needed most was clarity—what to fix, how to fix it, and the confidence that they weren’t walking alone.

That’s where grace mattered. Grace didn’t mean lowering the bar or excusing failure. It meant I approached the conversation with awareness. I understood the pressures, the fatigue, the reality that mistakes often came from confusion or overload, not malice or laziness. Grace gave people the freedom to be honest about what went wrong without fear of being crushed for it.

But grace alone isn’t enough. Pair it with accountability, and you create momentum. Once the problem was on the table, the focus turned to solutions: What needs to change? How do we make sure it doesn’t happen again? What resources or clarity are missing? The energy shifted from blame to progress.

Research backs this up. Gallup reports that employees who receive meaningful feedback weekly are nearly three times more engaged than those who don’t. Other studies show organizations with strong feedback cultures see turnover drop by double digits. These numbers aren’t just statistics—they confirm what we saw every day: feedback delivered with grace and clarity strengthens commitment instead of eroding it.

Some leaders miss this balance. They lean too hard on accountability, turning feedback into punishment. Others lean only on grace, softening every issue until nothing changes. Servant leadership demands both. Truth delivered with care. Standards held with empathy. A clear plan laid out with the confidence that we’ll get there together.

That rhythm—agenda, problem, path forward—wasn’t just a method for me. It was how I protected the culture. It reminded everyone that mistakes weren’t the end of the story. Growth was still possible. Trust was still intact. The work still mattered, and so did they.

Takeaways

The Cultural Payoff

When feedback is delivered with clarity, grace, and accountability, the payoff shows up everywhere. It shows up in trust, in performance, and in the kind of culture that makes people excited to come to work.

I saw it firsthand. My team wasn’t afraid of feedback—they expected it. They knew it wasn’t going to be random, petty, or manipulative. They knew correction would be honest and direct, and it would always come with a path forward. That predictability gave us the ability to run hot without burning out. People didn’t waste energy protecting themselves. They poured it into solving problems and advancing the work.

That’s why the crying couch became a symbol in our office. People knew they could sit down, tell me anything—from personal struggles to work-related mistakes—and it would be safe. Feedback wasn’t just about performance. It was about creating a place where people could bring their whole selves, knowing they wouldn’t be dismissed or destroyed for it. That kind of psychological safety freed people to be bold in the work and honest in the struggle.

The payoff showed up in loyalty too. My team wasn’t just compliant; they were committed. They trusted me enough to run hard, because they knew I wasn’t going to blindside them with hidden expectations or punish them for being human. They knew correction wasn’t about taking them down—it was about building them up.

The research echoes what we lived. Gallup has shown that organizations where employees strongly agree their manager provides meaningful feedback see nearly three times the level of engagement compared to those where feedback is rare. Harvard Business Review has documented that feedback-rich cultures are also more innovative, because people aren’t afraid to speak up. And MIT Sloan points out that psychological safety is one of the strongest predictors of high-performing teams.

Leaders who try to “win” every interaction end up alone. Their people avoid them, hide from them, or eventually leave. But leaders who treat feedback as service—who deliver it with clarity, humility, and care—build teams that last. They don’t just extract effort; they multiply it. They don’t just protect themselves; they protect the culture. And they create environments where people don’t just work hard—they work with heart.

That’s the cultural payoff of feedback done well. It’s not just better performance—it’s stronger trust, deeper loyalty, and a team that’s willing to climb the shared mountain with you. And that, at the end of the day, is the whole point of servant leadership: not to stand at the top of the hill alone, but to reach the summit together.
