# Chapter 13: Protect the Culture

## Theology

### Spend Your Social Capital

When I talk about protecting culture, I use the phrase “social capital.” It’s not something you can deposit in a bank or measure on a spreadsheet, but every leader knows it exists. It’s the trust, credibility, and goodwill you build with your people. You earn it over time by the way you show up, and you spend it every time you make a hard call.

Research confirms what most leaders feel intuitively. A 2023 MIT Sloan study analyzing over a million employee reviews found that toxic workplace behaviors—not pay or workload—were the single strongest predictor of turnover. In plain terms: culture outpaces compensation.

From the beginning, I wasn’t just the owner—I was also a worker. I was carrying weight on both sides, responsible for setting the culture while also living under it. That tension gave me a rare opportunity to ask myself a question most leaders never stop to consider: How would I want to be led? The answer to that question became the foundation for the way I would lead in the years to come. Authority might have been mine by title, but leadership was going to be proved in the way people responded when I acted.

As we grew, my role shifted. I wasn’t just the owner setting culture anymore—I was also a manager. That meant carrying it down into the teams, making sure expectations weren’t just posters on a wall but lived realities. I had to ensure that when my people walked into a project or a client meeting, they knew what “our way” looked like. Culture isn’t a mission statement; it’s the tone of the conversations, the way we handle problems, and the consistency of our decisions when things get tough.

Here’s the truth: culture is most visible when it’s under threat. It’s easy to talk about values when business is booming and clients are happy. But when a client is frustrated, or a leader drifts, or an employee cuts corners, the whole organization turns to watch—what will leadership do now?

That’s where social capital gets spent. I couldn’t rely on my authority as an owner. Authority is positional; it forces compliance. Social capital is relational; it earns trust. And in the kind of companies I’ve led—growing past a hundred people—the real currency was trust. The same principle applies whether you’re running a software firm like mine, a gym, a manufacturing shop, or a nonprofit. Industry doesn’t change the fact that people will follow what you do, not just what you say.

Every time I defended the people in my care, or owned a mistake on behalf of the company, I was withdrawing from that account. Every time I chose to slow down revenue in order to uphold our standards, I was spending it. And every time I did, I had to be mindful: how do I keep this tank full? The answer was simple but not easy—I had to respect everyone involved. That meant caring for clients, caring for employees, and caring for the company itself, even when those values collided.

Protecting culture was never about flexing power. If I had wanted to, I could have forced outcomes with my title. But culture can’t be bullied into place. Real culture is built when people see you act with integrity, even when it costs you something. That’s where loyalty takes root.

There’s another layer to this, one most leaders don’t want to admit: sometimes protecting culture feeds resistance. Not everyone values it. There are leaders, partners, even employees who see culture as “soft”—a distraction from revenue, something that slows progress. To them, profit is the only scoreboard that matters. They don’t care if people get bruised along the way, so long as the numbers line up.

One large-scale analysis published by MIT Sloan found that toxic culture is over ten times more predictive of attrition than pay. If you won’t spend social capital to protect the room, the room spends people.

For me, the opposite was true. Protecting culture wasn’t slowing progress; it was protecting the long game. Without it, any success we had would have been built on a house of cards. That doesn’t mean it didn’t cost me. There were times when defending the culture drained me of almost all my social capital, and yes—at times it lit fires under people who resented the very idea of slowing down for the sake of people. But the alternative—compromise—wasn’t an option.

Research backs this up. MIT Sloan found in 2022 that toxic culture is 10 times more predictive of employee attrition than compensation. Gallup estimates that toxic workplaces cost U.S. companies $223 billion over five years in turnover alone. And Edgar Schein, one of the foremost voices on organizational culture, wrote that leaders preserve culture by what they consistently pay attention to and reward. In other words, what you defend—or ignore—becomes the real culture.

Culture isn’t a vibe; it shows up in outcomes you can count. High-trust teams report fewer preventable errors, faster cycle times, and tighter handoffs because people surface issues early instead of hiding them. Retention follows the same logic: when standards and dignity are defended, voluntary exits fall, recruiting drag shrinks, and institutional knowledge stays put. That’s the culture math leaders actually feel—slower leakage, steadier delivery, and fewer “heroics” needed to overcome avoidable breakdowns.

That’s why I tell leaders this: if you’re not willing to spend social capital to protect the culture you say you value, then you don’t really have a culture. You have slogans. And slogans don’t hold when pressure hits.

## Stories

### The Twine Client Story

There’s one moment that stands out when I think about spending social capital to protect our culture, and it cost us both money and pride. We were working with a manufacturer and seller of twine—a company that trusted us with a project they needed done right. They weren’t a flashy client, but their business mattered, and we treated it like it mattered. At least, we were supposed to.

The truth is, we failed them.

One of our engineers—an incredibly skilled developer, but not aligned with how we served clients—decided to go his own way. On paper, he was perfect for the job. Smart, technically sound, capable of solving problems that would make most engineers sweat. But in reality, he was more interested in proving he was right than in listening to the client. He heard their needs but filtered them through his own opinion of what should be built, and he pushed forward on that track even when it didn’t line up with the direction we had agreed upon. Or in some cases, he was making no progress at all, choosing instead to focus on other tasks that weren’t even in his sphere at the time.

That was a direct conflict with our culture. We had always said our expertise mattered, but it existed to serve the client’s needs, not override them.

That’s when I knew the project was lost. There was no saving it.

I can still remember the pit in my stomach as I shifted conversations with the client. What had started as updates and check-ins turned into apologies and course corrections. I wasn’t just speaking for myself—I was carrying the weight of the company. If I tried to spin the situation or push the blame down to one employee, I might have saved face in the short term. But I would’ve shattered the culture we’d been fighting for.

That’s where Kahlie’s phrase came to life for us: fail fast, learn fast. It became a foundation for how we handled breakdowns. If you fail, you don’t cover it up. You don’t keep stacking cards on a shaky foundation. You own it, fix what you can, and if you can’t, you make it right.

Making it right meant refunding the client. Every penny.

There’s a reason that move works beyond ethics. In service-recovery research, two moves consistently repair trust: (1) a clear, unqualified admission of failure and (2) a concrete remedy that over-corrects the loss (speed, access, or money). What fails is the half-measure—vague language, shared blame, or a token credit—because it keeps the injury ambiguous. A clean refund did two things at once: it removed any financial argument from the table and recentered the relationship on fairness. That reset made further conversation possible without defensiveness on either side.

It’s amazing how much clarity comes when you remove the money from the equation. The moment I told them, “This project hasn’t gone the way it should have, and we’re going to refund you in full,” the tone shifted. They didn’t have to fight us for fairness. They didn’t have to wonder if they’d been cheated. They still had faith in us—not because we delivered the project, but because we delivered honesty. That’s rare in business.

Meanwhile, the conversations with the engineer were unfolding in parallel. I didn’t come at him with anger or public humiliation. But I did hold a mirror up to the choice he had made. It wasn’t a matter of skill—he was brilliant. It was a matter of values. He had chosen to exert control over a client who trusted us, and that violated the very foundation of our culture. In our company, we served. Full stop.

In the end, I didn’t have to terminate him. The weight of the situation did its own work. He saw that he didn’t fit in a culture where service to the client was non-negotiable, and he resigned.

On paper, it looks like a loss. We lost a client. We lost revenue. We lost an engineer. But that’s not the whole story. What we really did was preserve the culture. My team saw that we would take a hit before we would compromise on our values. They saw that leadership meant owning failure and protecting the client, not scrambling to protect our pride.

That one moment reinforced years of teaching: serve each other, serve our clients. It wasn’t a slogan anymore—it was lived out in real time. And the lesson stuck: culture is fragile, but when you protect it at all costs, it gets stronger with every test.

Service recovery literature says honest resets create more loyalty than quiet cover-ups. Owning the miss—then making it right—protects culture and reputation at the same time.

## Takeaways

### The Ripple Effect

After the dust settled with the twine client, something happened that mattered more than the refund, more than the resignation, more than the immediate loss. The team exhaled. Not with surprise, but with relief. They had seen this pattern from me before, and now they saw it again.

If there was any fear at all, it wasn’t widespread. Healthy culture removes most of that fear before it has a chance to take root. My people weren’t worried about whether I’d lose my temper or try to gloss over the situation with half-truths. They had learned what to expect: I would care for the humans involved. I would tell the truth. I would make things right. That consistency let them face a failure like this without bracing for punishment or deception.

The only person who had reason to feel tension was the engineer who chose his own path over the client’s. And even then, the tension wasn’t because I threatened him or embarrassed him—it was because the culture itself made the misalignment clear. He realized on his own that his way of working didn’t belong inside the walls we were building. That’s the kind of accountability a strong culture creates: people either align with it or step out of it.

What struck me most was how the situation deepened trust. You might expect an incident like this to damage morale, but in reality it had the opposite effect. Trust compounds when behavior is predictable under stress. People don’t memorize values on a wall; they remember what leaders did when it was expensive. Each time a team watches you choose integrity over revenue, the cost of coordination falls—fewer “proof” meetings, fewer escalations, faster decisions. That’s the quiet dividend of culture protection: speed without spin. The team’s confidence in leadership went up. They saw, firsthand, that our motto wasn’t just words. Serve each other. Serve our clients. It was the real thing. They saw that protecting clients was part of protecting them. And they saw that I wasn’t going to let fear of short-term loss dictate our choices.

That’s the difference between a fear-driven culture and a trust-driven one. In fear-driven companies, people hold their breath every time a problem surfaces. Will the leader explode? Will someone get scapegoated? Will the client be misled just to keep the revenue stream alive? Those companies run on survival, not trust. Fear may get compliance, but it never earns loyalty.

In our company, we had a different rhythm. Good communication, healthy expectations, and a culture that wasn’t built on succeed-or-die pressure meant we could face problems honestly. A failed project didn’t spell doom for an employee—unless they were unwilling to own their choices. The weight didn’t fall on individuals to cover mistakes; it fell on leadership to own them and make it right. That kind of accountability creates security, not instability.

Research confirms this. A 2023 study in Harvard Business Review found that companies with strong cultures of trust consistently outperform peers in employee retention, innovation, and even stock performance. Culture isn’t “soft.” It’s strategic. And the cost of ignoring it shows up quickly—in turnover, disengagement, and collapse of credibility.

I didn’t want this one incident to be a dramatic turning point in the company’s story. If it had been, that would’ve meant we weren’t living consistently before. What I wanted—and what I think we achieved—was for this to feel like business as usual. Yes, we failed. Yes, it cost us. But the way we handled it lined up with what the team already expected from me. That’s the true measure of culture: not the slogans you write or the meetings you host, but the behavior people come to count on when things go wrong.

The lesson for me, and for anyone leading in that 10–250 range, is simple but not easy: protecting culture will always cost you something. It might be money, as it was with the refund. It might be talent, as it was when the engineer resigned. It might be energy, as you spend your social capital to defend what matters. But the cost of not protecting culture is far greater. 

Compromise once, and you teach your people that the values on the wall don’t mean anything. Compromise twice, and you’ll find yourself leading a company that looks stable from the outside but is hollow on the inside. That’s the house of cards I’ve seen too many leaders build.

What you spend on protecting culture isn’t wasted—it’s invested. Every time you show your team that values matter more than short-term gain, you’re putting deposits back into the trust account.

**Pocket rule: If you won’t spend for culture when it hurts, you’re just renting your values.**

You’re proving that leadership isn’t just authority; it’s action. And in the long run, that’s what builds a company people want to follow, not just work for.
