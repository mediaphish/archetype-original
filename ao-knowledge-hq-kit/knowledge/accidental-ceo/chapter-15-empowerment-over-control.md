# Chapter 15: Empowerment Over Control

## Theology

### Trust People to Grow; Don’t Trap Them

One of the simplest mistakes leaders make is clinging to control. It feels safer in the moment.

Google’s Project Aristotle exposed that illusion of safety. Over two years and 180 teams, they learned that the highest-performing groups weren’t the ones most tightly managed—they were the ones that felt most trusted. Psychological safety—permission to question, try, and fail without blame—was the defining variable (Google Re:Work, 2016). Control removes short-term risk; empowerment removes long-term barriers.

**Pocket rule:** Fear manages. Trust multiplies.

If I keep my hands on everything, if I hold every detail and every decision, then nothing can go wrong without my say-so. On the surface, it looks like strength. But the truth is, control is just fear with a polished face.

Servant leadership takes a different path. It says the role of a leader is not to trap people in dependency but to empower them to grow. Empowerment means releasing real responsibility to others.

Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace 2023 found that employees who strongly agree they can make decisions about their work are 3.7 times more likely to be engaged and 2.1 times more likely to stay with their employer. Yet fewer than one in three report having that level of freedom. Real responsibility builds confidence; token gestures just create spectators.

**Pocket rule:** Ownership outperforms oversight.

It means risking the chance of failure in exchange for the possibility of growth. And it means believing that the long-term health of a business is tied directly to the long-term health of its people.

I never had to learn this lesson the hard way, because empowerment was always my natural posture. From the beginning, I hired people with two qualities in mind: character strong enough to go to war with, and skill—or potential skill—greater than mine. I’ve always been more of a jack of all trades. That made my job simple: find people who could be better, and then give them space to rise.

## Stories

### Empowerment in Action — The Story of Marcus

Marcus is one of the clearest examples of empowerment in action.

When I first met Marcus, he was fresh out of college, working for a major retailer, and hating his life. We connected through CrossFit, and our conversations stretched over time. Eventually, I brought him on board, thinking he might be a good fit for sales. It didn’t take long for both of us to realize that wasn’t his path.

That could have been the end of the story. In many businesses, when someone doesn’t fit the first role they’re handed, they’re written off as a bad hire. But I wasn’t interested in cutting him loose—I was interested in finding where his strengths could flourish. So I started small. I gave him lists of administrative tasks—HR paperwork, accounting odds and ends, all the things that needed doing but I didn’t have time to touch. Marcus shredded every list. Not just completed—perfected. No typos. No shortcuts. Just reliable execution every time.

I kept giving him more. The more I empowered him, the more he rose. Marcus eventually became, in all but title, our Office Manager and HR Director. He was the steady hand that kept the operations of the business together, the person the rest of the team could count on. And he’s still at Midwestern Interactive today, carrying responsibilities that most leaders don’t realize they’ve left sitting on his shoulders.

Do we know what Marcus is fully capable of? Not yet. He still has so much more to offer. But I do know this: empowering him in those small roles gave him the foundation for something he can carry the rest of his life. That’s the real measure of leadership. It’s not just about what a person does for your business—it’s about what they become because of the opportunities you gave them.

That’s the heartbeat of servant leadership. You don’t control people to get output. You empower them so they can grow. Sometimes that means discovering hidden strengths, like Marcus moving from failed salesman to operational backbone. Sometimes it means letting someone find their lane in a way you didn’t expect. But it always means choosing to lift instead of trap.

Empowerment isn’t a fallback plan—it’s the flag I’ve carried through my entire leadership journey. From Marcus to dozens of others, the story is the same: when people are trusted, they rise. Sometimes that means finding strengths no one expected. Sometimes it means building careers in places they never thought they belonged. Always it means creating space for people to grow into more than just employees. That’s the kind of culture worth building, and the kind of leadership worth practicing.

MIT Sloan’s 2023 Management Review analyzed more than 10,000 manager–employee interactions across multiple industries. The pattern was clear: teams with high decision latency—those forced to wait for manager approval at every step—were 20–25% slower to execute and over 30% more likely to burn out within a year. Micromanagement doesn’t protect quality; it chokes momentum. Every approval gate creates a line of people standing still when they could be moving. Empowerment reverses that—trust shrinks the line and releases the capacity you already have.

**Pocket rule:** Stop guarding the gate and watch the road clear.

## Takeaways

### Contrast — Control vs. Empowerment

The easiest thing a leader can do is control. It feels safe.

Deloitte’s Human Capital Trends 2022 surveyed over 11,000 leaders worldwide and found organizations that push authority closer to the front line are 1.4× more likely to report high innovation and 1.7× more likely to achieve top-quartile financial results. Control might feel efficient, but empowerment compounds—it creates more people capable of leading when you’re not in the room.

**Pocket rule:** Teach decisions, not dependence.

If I hold all the information, all the authority, and all the decision-making power, then nothing can go wrong without my say-so. On the surface, that looks like strong leadership. In reality, it’s just fear disguised as order.

I’ve seen this fear play out in its most extreme form. Instead of empowering people to grow, a so-called leader literally sat down at their staff’s desks and took over their projects. Think about that for a second. Instead of teaching, guiding, or correcting, they just did the work themselves. That’s not leadership—it’s ego. No one gets better in that environment. There’s no growth, no scale, and no future. The only thing that gets fed is the leader’s pride.

Empowerment takes the opposite posture. It requires risk. It means trusting people with real responsibility, knowing full well they might stumble. But it also creates loyalty, energy, and long-term strength. People who are empowered don’t just do the work—they own it. They find better ways, they innovate, and they bring their whole selves to the table.

But empowerment only works when it’s paired with clarity. Handing someone responsibility without a clear plan isn’t empowerment—it’s abandonment. If the expectations aren’t defined, if the path isn’t understood, then what you’ve really done is set the person, the task, and ultimately the business up for failure. Clarity and empowerment aren’t separate fundamentals. They are partners. One steadies the ground; the other gives people room to run.

I saw this difference play out in real time at Midwestern Interactive. Marcus is one example of empowerment. On the flip side, I also saw what happened in environments where empowerment wasn’t given. People were controlled into silence. They were technically present but disengaged. The work got done, but the spark was gone.

Research backs up what experience makes obvious. Gallup reports that employees who feel empowered are 67% more engaged and significantly more likely to stay long-term. Harvard Business Review has shown that empowerment cultures outperform control-heavy ones not just in morale, but in innovation and revenue growth. Control may deliver short-term compliance, but empowerment produces long-term impact.

### Empowerment as Risk and Legacy

Empowerment is risky. There’s no way around that. When you hand someone responsibility, you’re giving them the chance to stumble. You’re also giving them the chance to rise higher than either of you imagined. That’s why control feels safer—because it removes the risk.
 
Google’s Project Aristotle proved it. After analyzing 180 teams over two years, the single strongest predictor of performance wasn’t skill mix or experience—it was psychological safety. Teams that felt trusted to speak up and make decisions without punishment outperformed others on every success metric (Google Re:Work, 2016). Control feels safe because it limits risk, but it also limits growth. When leaders release their grip, ownership and creativity rush in to fill the space they once occupied.

**Pocket rule:** The tighter the grip, the smaller the team becomes.

But in removing the risk, it also removes the growth.

In my career, I’ve seen the risk pay off far more often than it backfired. Marcus is one example, but he’s not alone. Dozens of people found their place because someone trusted them with responsibility before they were “ready.” They were stretched, challenged, and sometimes uncomfortable, but they grew. They became more than employees filling a job description. They became leaders in their own right.

That’s the point of empowerment. It’s not just about increasing output for the company—it’s about elevating lives. Businesses that empower people end up with stronger teams, better ideas, and deeper loyalty. But the real reward is watching someone discover who they’re capable of becoming.

The opposite path—control—may look steady in the short term, but it always collapses in the long term. Controlled people don’t stay engaged. They don’t innovate. They don’t stay. And when they leave, they take with them whatever potential was buried under the weight of a leader’s ego.

Leadership is about more than holding authority. It’s about releasing it at the right moments, in the right ways, with the right clarity. That’s what gives people space to step forward. That’s what builds a culture of trust and growth instead of fear and survival.

If there’s a legacy worth leaving behind as a leader, it isn’t just a profitable business or a list of accomplishments. It’s people—people who can point back to their time under your leadership and say, “That’s where I grew. That’s where I was trusted. That’s where I was empowered.”

That’s the legacy empowerment leaves. And it’s the kind of leadership that endures.
