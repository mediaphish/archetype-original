Yes—but they're intentionally simple.

The methods used here focus on helping leaders see patterns: how decisions are being made, how pressure is moving through the organization, and what behaviors are being reinforced over time. Tools exist to support that clarity, not to replace judgment.

If a tool creates dependence or obscures responsibility, it doesn't belong here.
