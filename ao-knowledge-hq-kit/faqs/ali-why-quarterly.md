Annual surveys are obsolete before the results are presented.

Small and mid-sized organizations shift quickly:

new hires change chemistry
seasonality affects tone
stress cycles impact consistency
growth shifts clarity and alignment
leaders drift when overwhelmed

Quarterly measurement captures movement, not snapshots.

Leadership doesn’t change annually.
It changes weekly.

ALI detects quarterly patterns.
