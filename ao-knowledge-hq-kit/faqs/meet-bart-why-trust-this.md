You shouldn't trust it because it sounds polished or confident. You should trust it if it explains your experience more accurately than what you've been told before.

Most leaders arrive here because something doesn't quite add up. The numbers might still be fine, but the room feels different. Conversations are shorter. Feedback is thinner. Decisions feel heavier than they used to. You can't point to one failure, but you know something is shifting.

This work exists because those moments are real—and common—and most leadership language doesn't explain them very well. The frameworks here are meant to give you language for what you're already noticing, and a way to respond that doesn't create more damage in the process.

Trust builds when something finally makes sense. That's the test.
