Because sentiment is unreliable.

People can feel frustrated even in a strong leadership environment.  
People can feel content even while conditions are quietly eroding.

Sentiment fluctuates with stress, home life, personalities, and seasons.  
Conditions do not lie.

ALI measures the **reality leaders create**, not the fleeting emotional interpretation of it.

By focusing on conditions, ALI gives leaders something sentiment-based tools never can:  
a clear view of what is actually forming beneath the surface.
