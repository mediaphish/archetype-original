Yes—and this is one of the most common reasons leaders reach out.

Growth introduces pressure. Pressure exposes patterns. Without clarity, teams default to speed, control, and short-term fixes that slowly erode trust. Bart helps leaders anticipate those moments instead of reacting to them after damage is done.

This work focuses on helping leaders scale their own capacity—clarity, restraint, consistency—so the culture doesn't fracture as complexity increases.

Scaling well is less about adding systems and more about stabilizing leadership behavior as demands grow.
