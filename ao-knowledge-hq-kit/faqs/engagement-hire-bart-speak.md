Yes—if the goal is clarity, not hype.

Bart does speak to teams, leadership groups, and organizations, but the focus is never on motivation for its own sake. These sessions are designed to help people understand what leadership is actually doing to their environment and why certain patterns keep repeating.

If you're looking for a high-energy keynote meant to entertain or temporarily inspire, this likely isn't the right fit. If you want a room to leave with shared language, clearer responsibility, and a better understanding of how pressure, tone, and behavior affect execution, then speaking engagements can be a strong starting point.

Many organizations use these sessions as a reset—not an ending.
