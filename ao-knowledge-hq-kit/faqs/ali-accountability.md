ALI gives leaders:

visibility into their own patterns
visibility into how behavior impacts conditions
visibility into how stability or drift affects execution
visibility into how tone influences the environment

Leaders rarely drift intentionally.
ALI reveals drift early enough to correct it quickly.

Accountability becomes about meaningful change, not punishment.
