Yes—but not by arguing with you.

The challenge comes from clarity. When ideas are explained cleanly and consistently, contradictions tend to surface on their own. Archy helps by making the logic visible, so you can see where your assumptions might be misaligned with reality.

The goal isn’t to win an argument. It’s to help you see more clearly.
