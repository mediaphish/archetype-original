Yes—but not by treating culture as a surface problem.

Culture work here doesn't start with values exercises or morale programs. It starts with leadership behavior and the conditions people are working inside every day. That often means working first with senior leaders before involving the broader team.

In some cases, Bart will work directly with leadership teams. In others, the work begins quietly, helping a founder or executive understand what they are unintentionally reinforcing—and how to correct course without creating fear or instability.

Culture improves when leadership behavior changes consistently. Everything else follows from that.
