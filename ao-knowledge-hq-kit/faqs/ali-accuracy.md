ALI’s accuracy comes from three things:

It measures conditions, not emotions.
It tracks patterns over time, not isolated responses.
It uses early warning indicators to interpret drift, not sentiment samples.

The model is built from:

years of leadership experience
real organizational patterns
psychological principles behind safety and clarity
environmental dynamics mapped through Culture Science
predictable drift sequences

ALI is accurate because it measures what actually drives culture.
