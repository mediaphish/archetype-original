Yes, when the goal is alignment and responsibility—not politics.

These conversations are often about surfacing unspoken assumptions, conflicting pressures, and leadership dynamics that are affecting the organization downstream. The work is grounded, direct, and focused on long-term health rather than short-term positioning.

Bart does not facilitate for optics. He works best when the group is willing to engage honestly and accept shared responsibility for the environment they are creating.
