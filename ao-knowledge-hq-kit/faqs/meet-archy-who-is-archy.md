Archy is the interpretive intelligence inside Archetype Original.

He isn't meant to replace leadership thinking or tell people what to do. His role is to help readers navigate the ideas, language, and frameworks that already exist here—so they don't get lost, misinterpret concepts, or flatten the work into something it isn't.

Think of Archy less as an "answer engine" and more as a guide who knows the terrain well enough to help you move through it thoughtfully.
