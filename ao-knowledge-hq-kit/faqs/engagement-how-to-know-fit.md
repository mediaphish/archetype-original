If you're asking that question, it usually means something already feels unresolved.

Leaders who benefit most from this work aren't looking for answers they can repeat. They're looking for understanding that changes how they lead day to day. They want fewer surprises, fewer breakdowns, and fewer moments where pressure causes unintended harm.

If you want a framework that makes you look good, you won't like this. If you want one that makes you better, you're in the right place.
