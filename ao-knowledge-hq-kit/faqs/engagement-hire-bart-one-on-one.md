Yes—and this is where the work often goes deepest.

Bart works one-on-one with leaders who are carrying real responsibility and want space to think clearly, honestly, and without performance. These engagements are not coaching in the traditional sense. There's no script, no cheerleading, and no pressure to present a version of yourself that sounds good.

The focus is on helping you see patterns—in your decisions, your reactions, and your leadership under pressure—and understanding how those patterns are shaping the people around you.

This work is especially helpful for leaders who feel the weight of their role but don't have a place to process it thoughtfully.
