No. And that distinction matters.

Archetype Original isn't centered on personality or visibility. It's centered on responsibility. Bart's name is attached to the work because leadership requires ownership—someone willing to stand behind the ideas and be accountable for them.

But the aim isn't attention. It's usefulness. The frameworks, language, and tools here are meant to stand on their own and be used by leaders long after they've moved on from any one voice or season.

If anything, this work pushes against ego-driven leadership rather than feeding it.
