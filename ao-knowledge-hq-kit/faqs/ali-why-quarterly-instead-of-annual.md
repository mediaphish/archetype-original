Annual surveys are obsolete before the results are presented.

Small and mid-sized organizations shift quickly:

- new hires change chemistry  
- seasonality affects tone  
- stress cycles impact consistency  
- growth shifts clarity and alignment  
- leaders drift when overwhelmed  

Quarterly measurement captures **movement**, not snapshots.

Leadership doesn’t change annually.  
It changes weekly.

ALI detects quarterly patterns so leaders can respond while change is still manageable.
