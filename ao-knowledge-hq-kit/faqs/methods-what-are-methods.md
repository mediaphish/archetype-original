Methods are how the philosophy shows up in real leadership situations.

This isn't a fixed program or a step-by-step system meant to be applied the same way everywhere. Methods here are principles-in-action—ways of diagnosing what's happening, responding under pressure, and correcting course without creating fear or instability.

The goal isn't compliance. It's clarity and consistency.
