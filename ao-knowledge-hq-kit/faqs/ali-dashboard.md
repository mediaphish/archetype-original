The dashboard reveals:

which conditions are stable
which are drifting
how fast they’re drifting
which early warning indicators are active
which leadership behaviors are contributing
how the environment is trending over time

These patterns are invisible without structured measurement—especially when leaders are stressed, busy, or relying on intuition.
