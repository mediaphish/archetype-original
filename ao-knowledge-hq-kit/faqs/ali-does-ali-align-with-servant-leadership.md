Yes.

ALI is built on the structural truths of servant leadership:

- leaders create conditions  
- conditions shape people  
- people shape outcomes  
- leaders are responsible for the wake they create  

ALI is not a philosophical tool.  
It is a **measurement system for servant leadership in practice**.

It gives servant leaders visibility into whether their leadership is actually creating the conditions they intend.
