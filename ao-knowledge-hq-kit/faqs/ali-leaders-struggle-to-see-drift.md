Leaders struggle to see drift because they sit inside the system they're trying to evaluate.

From inside, it feels normal.
From outside, the pattern is obvious.

Teams adapt quietly.
Leaders interpret generously.
And drift appears slowly.

ALI gives leaders external visibility into the conditions they are unintentionally shaping.
