Use ALI to:

identify your true leadership priorities
stabilize your team before performance declines
understand where communication is breaking down
see how tone affects safety
recognize inconsistencies before they become norms
align leadership decisions
make intentional leadership adjustments

ALI is not a performance score.
It’s a navigation tool.
