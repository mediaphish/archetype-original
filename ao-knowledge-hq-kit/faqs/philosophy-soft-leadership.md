No. It's disciplined leadership.

Soft leadership avoids hard conversations and accountability. Unrestrained leadership creates volatility, fear, and burnout. Archetype Original sits between the two—strength under control.

It asks leaders to regulate themselves under pressure, to correct problems without exporting stress, and to lead in ways that hold up over time rather than creating short-term compliance.
