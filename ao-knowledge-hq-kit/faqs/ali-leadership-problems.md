Nearly all leadership problems trace back to one or more weakened conditions:

misalignment → Clarity
conflict → Communication or Safety
turnover → Trust, Tone, or Safety
slow execution → Clarity or Consistency
disengagement → Tone, Safety, or Trust
friction → Communication
reactive leadership → Consistency
strategy breakdown → Clarity

ALI reveals the root condition, not just the symptom.
