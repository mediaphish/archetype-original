Leadership drift is predictable.

Every drift cycle begins with:

- rising silence  
- expectation gaps  
- minor inconsistencies  
- early communication distortion  
- emotional compression  
- tension avoidance  

These signals appear **months before** cultural breakdown or performance problems.

ALI’s questions, indicators, and pattern logic are built to detect these shifts early—when leaders can still correct them without major damage.

Drift rarely announces itself.  
ALI is designed to see it anyway.
