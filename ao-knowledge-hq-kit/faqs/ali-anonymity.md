Yes, ALI is fully anonymous.

Without anonymity:

safety becomes impossible
people filter their answers
tone and trust cannot be measured honestly
drift in leadership behavior becomes invisible

Anonymity is required to measure the real conditions inside the culture—not the story people feel pressured to tell.
