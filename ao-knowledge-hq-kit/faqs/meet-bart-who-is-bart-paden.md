If you're asking this, you're probably trying to decide whether what you're reading here is theoretical—or earned.

Bart Paden is a founder, operator, and long-time leader who has spent decades inside real organizations, carrying responsibility for people, outcomes, and culture. His work wasn't formed in classrooms or conferences. It was formed in boardrooms, small offices, gyms, startups, and seasons where leadership decisions carried real personal and financial cost.

Archetype Original exists because Bart has lived through both growth and collapse—and learned that leadership problems are rarely technical. They are behavioral. Cultural. Human.

This work is not about image, influence, or personal brand. It's about helping leaders understand what they are actually creating around them—often without realizing it—and how to take responsibility for that with clarity and restraint.
