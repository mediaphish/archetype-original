ALI measures the leadership conditions people work inside every day—**Clarity, Trust, Communication, Consistency, Safety, and Emotional Tone**.

These conditions determine:

- how teams think  
- how they communicate  
- how they make decisions  
- how they take risks  
- how they handle conflict  
- how they align  
- how they execute  

Most leadership tools measure emotions.

ALI measures the **environment leadership creates**, which is far more predictive and far more reliable.

Conditions shape behavior long before results appear.  
ALI makes those conditions visible.
