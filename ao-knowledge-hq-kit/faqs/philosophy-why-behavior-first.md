Because behavior is what people actually experience.

Intentions matter, but people don't work inside a leader's intent. They work inside patterns: how decisions are made, how mistakes are handled, how pressure shows up, and how consistently leaders respond.

Behavior is the delivery system for values. Without it, values remain theoretical.
