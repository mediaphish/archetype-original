Most leaders don't fail because they don't care. They fail because no one ever taught them what leadership is actually doing beneath the surface.

Bart created Archetype Original after watching the same pattern repeat across different organizations and industries: well-intentioned leaders unknowingly creating instability, burnout, and distrust—then trying to fix those symptoms with tools that never addressed the cause.

Archetype Original exists to name what usually goes unnamed: how leadership behavior creates conditions, how pressure travels through systems, and how culture quietly forms long before anyone notices something is wrong.

This is not a motivational project. It's a corrective one.
