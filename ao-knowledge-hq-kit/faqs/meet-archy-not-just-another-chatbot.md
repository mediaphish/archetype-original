No—and that difference matters.

Most leadership chatbots are designed to sound helpful by generating something quickly. Archy is designed to be helpful by staying constrained. He works inside defined language, concepts, and boundaries so that the answers reinforce clarity instead of creating confusion.

That restraint is intentional. It’s what keeps the work coherent rather than diluted.
