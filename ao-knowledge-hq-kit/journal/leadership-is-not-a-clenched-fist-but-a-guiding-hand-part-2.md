# Leadership Is Not a Clenched Fist, but a Guiding Hand (Part 2)

![Leadership Is Not a Clenched Fist, but a Guiding Hand](../images/leadership-is-not-a-clenched-fist-but-a-guiding-hand-part-2.jpg)

It’s easy to say the right things about leadership. Plenty of leaders talk about culture, people, and values. They write vision statements and hang them on the wall. They tell their teams, “I’ve got your back.”

But talk is cheap. When the pressure mounts, true leadership isn’t revealed in slogans or speeches. It shows up in action. A guiding hand can’t just be promised—it has to be lived.

## Listening Before Directing

A clenched fist says, “Here’s the plan. Don’t question me.” A guiding hand starts with a different posture: open ears. Leaders who live this way ask, “What do you see? What am I missing?” They make room for voices other than their own.

I’ve watched teams transform simply because the leader finally stopped talking long enough to listen. It’s amazing how quickly trust grows when people realize their ideas matter. Listening is one of the simplest ways to extend your hand.

## Protecting Your People

Another way leaders live this out is by protecting their people. When someone crosses the line—whether it’s a client, a partner, or another leader—the guiding hand doesn’t shrink back. It steps forward.

I’ll never forget a time when one of my team members was being treated unfairly. I stood up, made it clear that behavior wouldn’t be tolerated, and drew a line in the sand. That moment earned me the nickname “Pappa Bart.” It wasn’t about being tough for the sake of toughness—it was about letting my team know that if someone came after them, they’d have to go through me first.

That act didn’t cost us money, but honestly, I would’ve been fine if it had. Because what it gained was something money can’t buy: loyalty. When your team knows you’ll fight for them, they’ll fight with you. That’s not weakness—that’s strength channeled into protection.

## Teaching Instead of Telling

Micromanagement is the clenched fist in disguise. It demands tasks but never develops people. A guiding hand slows down to teach. It doesn’t just say, “Do it this way.” It explains why. It shows the process. It gives space to try again.

When mistakes happen, the clenched fist tightens harder. The guiding hand steadies, lifts, and coaches. Over time, this creates not only better work, but better people.

## Consistency in the Storm

Anyone can lead with a smile when things are going well. But when the storm hits, some leaders clench their fists even tighter. They snap. They rage. They demand.

The guiding hand steadies the ship. It sets the pace. It brings calm instead of chaos. People rarely remember how you led when things were easy. They remember how you acted when everything was on the line.

## Celebrating Progress

The clenched fist is stingy with recognition. Nothing is good enough. No effort is worth acknowledging. The guiding hand celebrates progress. It sees growth as worth naming, even if perfection isn’t reached.

Sometimes the most powerful leadership move is a simple word of encouragement. People thrive on knowing their effort matters. Small celebrations add up to big trust.

## Serving Before Being Served

The clenched fist demands service: “Do this for me. Make me look good. Carry my weight.” The guiding hand serves first. It shows up early. It stays late. It carries the hard things alongside the team.

When leaders serve this way, they don’t have to demand loyalty. They earn it.

## Living the Talk

Talk without action is manipulation. It’s the clenched fist wearing soft gloves. But action—consistent, sacrificial, people-first action—that’s the guiding hand in motion.

I’ve led long enough to know this: your people will eventually stop listening to what you say and start measuring what you do. And when your actions prove your words true, you won’t have to force anyone to stay. They’ll stay because they want to.

Leadership isn’t about promises. It’s about presence. Not about clenching tighter, but about opening your hand and walking with people. When you live the talk, you never have to force loyalty—it becomes the natural fruit of trust.
