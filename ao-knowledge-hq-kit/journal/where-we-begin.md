# Where We Begin

**The mission of Archetype Original is not to offer a program or system you can plug into for guaranteed results.**

It is a call to lead differently.

This work exists for builders—leaders who have come to understand that using people as tools eventually breaks both the people and the work. Leaders who have learned that winning the deal, hitting the number, or reaching the goal is hollow if the humans doing the work are diminished in the process.

At its core, Archetype Original is about service. About choosing to develop people, not consume them. About carrying authority in a way that strengthens rather than extracts.

For me, that conviction is grounded in Scripture.

The foundation of this work rests on a simple, demanding truth often referred to as the Golden Rule:

**Treat others the way you would want to be treated.**

This principle is not sentimental. It is disruptive. When taken seriously, it forces leaders to confront how their decisions, pressure, tone, and priorities actually land on the people around them. It exposes habits that are easy to justify in the name of results but impossible to defend when viewed through the lens of human experience.

From that ethic flows a leadership posture:

**Lead others the way you would want to be led.**

This is not a technique. It is an application. It asks leaders to examine not just what they intend, but what others experience—especially when power is unequal and stakes are high. It shapes how authority is used, how responsibility is carried, and how people are treated when outcomes are uncertain.

Today, we announce the creation of a **365-day Servant Leadership Devotional**.

This devotional exists as a daily practice rooted in the same theological ground described in *The Golden Rule Has Always Been a Leadership Strategy*. It is not a departure from that work, but an extension of it—a way to keep the ethic of service close in the ordinary, demanding rhythms of leadership.

Leadership drift is real. Pressure accumulates. Urgency crowds out reflection. Even leaders who genuinely care about people slowly default to habits that prioritize outcomes over humans. The devotional is designed to counter that drift, not with volume or intensity, but with consistency.

Each day offers a brief moment to return to first principles. To re-anchor leadership in the call to treat others as you would want to be treated—and to lead accordingly. Over time, those small moments compound. They shape discernment, steady decision-making, and help leaders carry responsibility without losing the people entrusted to them.

Not everyone who engages with Archetype Original will share my faith. That’s understood—and respected. Many are simply searching for a better way to lead, one that values people as humans rather than resources. This work is for them, too.

This page exists for those who want to understand the deeper ground beneath the work. It is here if you need it. It is not required to engage with the broader mission.

But it is where I begin—and where I return.

## A Daily Practice

If this grounding resonates with you, you’re invited to receive the Servant Leadership Devotional as a daily email.

Each entry is designed to be brief, intentional, and grounding—something you can return to at the start of the day or in the margin before decisions are made. Not to consume more content, but to stay anchored to the posture this work begins with.

You can sign up directly below, or learn more about the devotional on the [Servant Leadership Devotional](/faith) page. Engage at the pace and depth that makes sense for you.

This is not a requirement. It is an invitation.
