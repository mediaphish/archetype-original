# Clearing the Path

> “I don't push people forward. I clear what's in their way.”

Someone once asked me what kind of leader I try to be.  
I told them, “I don’t push people forward. I clear what’s in their way.”

That’s always been the heart of it for me. Leadership isn’t about driving or demanding—it’s about serving. It’s seeing what keeps your people from moving freely and quietly removing it.

### Leadership in Reverse

Too many leaders see their teams as machines built to make their own path easier. Their people exist to produce, protect, and promote the leader’s goals. It’s a subtle inversion of what leadership was meant to be — and it’s everywhere.

But true leadership flips that equation. The leader doesn’t stand on the cleared road; the leader *builds* it. My job isn’t to be carried by the team. My job is to carry what gets in their way.

### The Bulldozer Metaphor

I’ve always described myself as a bulldozer — not one that plows people over, but one that clears debris.  
That debris can look like confusion, bureaucracy, fear, or ego. It’s the stuff that clogs communication and erodes trust. When those things are gone, people move with confidence. They don’t need to be pushed — they start running on their own.

Servant leadership doesn’t make you the star of the show. It makes you the one quietly shaping the environment where others can thrive.

### The Real Measure

You can tell a lot about a leader by how easy the road is for the people behind them.  
Servant leaders don’t measure success by how effortless *their* path becomes, but by how smooth they’ve made the road for others.

When you clear the path, people stop working *for* you and start working *with* you.  
They stop protecting themselves and start protecting the mission.

Leadership isn't about getting others to build your vision faster.  
It’s about building an environment where others can see themselves as part of it.  

That’s what it means to clear the path — not to lead from above, but to walk ahead and make it safe for others to rise.
