# Leadership isn’t a scoreboard.

![Leadership isn’t a scoreboard.](../images/leadership-isnt-a-scoreboard.jpg)

Great leaders don’t flinch when their people win.  
They don’t feel threatened. They feel proud.  

Because real leaders understand this simple truth:  
Your team’s success is your success.  
Their growth is a reflection of your investment,  
your belief,  
your support.  

Insecure leaders compete with their own team.  
They hoard credit.  
They play power games.  
They build kingdoms where only one person gets to rise.  

But great leaders?  
They build platforms, not pedestals.  
They create environments where people get better—  
and then cheer when it happens.  

Leadership isn’t about being the best in the room.  
It’s about making sure your people know they belong in that room—  
and giving them everything they need to thrive.  

Support your team.  
Celebrate their wins.  
That’s how you build something that lasts.
