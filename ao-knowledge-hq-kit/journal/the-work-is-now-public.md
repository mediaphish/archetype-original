# The Work Is Now Public

Today, **Archetype Original** officially goes live.

Not as a finish line, but as a decision.

This site represents the convergence of decades of experience—building companies, leading teams, carrying responsibility, making mistakes, repairing damage, and learning what leadership actually costs when real people are involved.

For a long time, this work lived privately. In notebooks. In conversations. In moments where leadership decisions carried weight but little visibility. Over time, it became clear that keeping it private wasn’t serving anyone.

Most leadership problems aren’t technical.  
They’re human.

They show up as erosion before collapse.  
As silence before conflict.  
As burnout long before resignation.

Archetype Original exists to help leaders notice those signals earlier—and to think more clearly about how leadership, culture, faith, and responsibility intersect in real life.

This site is not a single idea or product. It is a platform for ongoing work.

It includes the **Journal**, where long-form reflection and practical thinking live side by side. It includes developing tools and resources designed to help leaders slow down, ask better questions, and see what is happening beneath the surface of their organizations and relationships.

One of those tools is **Archy**—an AI guide built from my writing, experience, and leadership philosophy. Archy isn’t here to replace wisdom, judgment, or conversation. It exists to help leaders think more clearly about the questions they are already carrying, especially when answers are not obvious.

Over time, Archetype Original will continue to grow—into mentorship, diagnostics, education, and practical tools for leaders in business, nonprofit, and faith-based organizations. But growth is not the goal.

**Health is.**

Leadership is not just about outcomes.  
It is about the wake we leave behind.

If you’ve found your way here because you’re leading something—and you’re trying to do it well without losing yourself or the people around you—this work is for you.

The work is now public.

And it’s only beginning.
