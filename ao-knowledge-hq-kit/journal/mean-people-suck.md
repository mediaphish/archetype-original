takeaways:
  - Meanness is often rebranded as strength once power enters the room.
  - Authoritarian and narcissistic traits can look effective early but scale damage over time.
  - Fear is not a leadership tool—it is a warning sign.
  - Leadership requires restraint, self-awareness, and responsibility, not intimidation.

# Mean People Suck. Especially When We Put Them in Charge.

I’ve been thinking about that old bumper sticker lately.  
You’ve probably seen it: **“Mean people suck.”**

It’s not clever. It’s not deep. It’s just… true.

And what’s strange is how universally we agree with it — until we start talking about leadership.

Somewhere along the way, we decided that meanness changes its name when power enters the room. We stop calling it what it is. We dress it up. We excuse it. We explain it away.

I’ve watched it happen more times than I can count.

The same behavior we’d never tolerate from a coworker suddenly becomes “tough leadership.” The sharp tone becomes “direct.” The intimidation becomes “accountability.” The emotional volatility becomes “passion.”

And everyone knows what’s really going on. They just don’t say it out loud.

What I’ve noticed is this: mean people often rise because they’re not slowed down by self-reflection. They don’t hesitate. They don’t wonder how they’re landing. They don’t second-guess themselves. In environments that reward speed, certainty, and control, that can look like strength.

For a while.

But meanness doesn’t stay contained. It leaks.

It leaks into meetings where no one pushes back.  
It leaks into cultures where people choose silence over honesty.  
It leaks into teams where everyone is managing the leader instead of doing the work.

I’ve seen incredibly capable people get smaller over time, not because they lacked talent, but because being around someone unpredictable and cutting is exhausting. You start conserving energy. You stop offering ideas. You stop taking risks — not because the work is risky, but because the leader is.

That’s not high standards. That’s fear.

And fear is a terrible operating system.

What bothers me most is how often we act surprised by the outcome. Turnover. Burnout. Quiet quitting. Collapsed trust. As if these things just appear out of nowhere.

They don’t.

They’re the downstream effects of putting mean people in positions where their behavior scales.

A mean person without authority is unpleasant.  
A mean person with authority reshapes the entire environment around them.

I don’t think leadership requires being soft. I don’t even think it requires being particularly nice. But it absolutely requires restraint. It requires self-control. It requires an awareness of how power amplifies whatever is already there.

The bumper sticker got it right. It just didn’t finish the sentence.

Mean people suck.  
And when we hand them power, they don’t just suck — they corrode everything around them.

That’s not a leadership philosophy.  
It’s just something I’ve watched play out, over and over again.
