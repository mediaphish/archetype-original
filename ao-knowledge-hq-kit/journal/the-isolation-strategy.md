# The Isolation Strategy

Some leaders build teams.  
Others build kingdoms.

And kingdoms always have one thing in common:  
distance.

Narcissistic leaders don’t just drift away from their teams — they engineer that distance. They create layers, buffers, and indirect communication channels that insulate them from accountability, truth, and the emotional impact of their decisions.

It’s not always dramatic. In fact, it often looks like professionalism, structure, or “high-level focus.” But over time, the pattern becomes clear:

Isolation isn’t an accident. It’s a strategy.

In small businesses, the isolation strategy is obvious. The leader becomes increasingly unavailable. Meetings become shorter and more controlled. Conversations turn into monologues. Team members start saying things like, “They’re busy,” or “It’s the season,” but the season never ends.

In larger organizations, isolation hides behind hierarchy. Direct reports become shields. Assistants become gatekeepers. Communication flows through carefully chosen intermediaries. The people who do the work rarely speak with the person making the decisions that affect them most.

Isolation becomes the leader’s most reliable defense.

Psychologists refer to this as relational avoidance, a form of defensive distancing rooted in insecurity. When leaders fear exposure, confrontation, or emotional discomfort, distance becomes a coping mechanism. But in narcissistic leadership, avoidance becomes something more intentional:

Isolation becomes a power structure.

The signs are clear:

Team members can’t get direct answers — everything is routed through someone else.  
Feedback has to “go through the right channels,” which somehow always lead to silence.  
The leader only emerges for announcements, crises, or credit.  
Concerns raised to the leader mysteriously reappear as “miscommunications” by others.  
Relationships inside the team become strained because no one has access to the same information.

The leader sits above it all, untouchable.  
And the team absorbs the weight they refuse to carry.

Research on organizational trust shows that transparency and direct communication are two of the strongest predictors of healthy culture. Remove those, and people begin making assumptions — usually negative ones. Isolation doesn’t just distance the leader; it fractures the team.

Nothing kills unity faster than distance disguised as authority.

Under isolation leadership, the team starts adapting in predictable ways:

People start managing around the leader instead of with them.  
Backchannel conversations multiply because front-channel communication is impossible.  
High performers lose visibility and eventually lose motivation.  
Low performers remain because proximity matters more than competence.  
The real culture becomes whatever happens when the leader isn’t in the room.

And what happens in their absence is rarely healthy.

Isolation is addictive for insecure leaders.  
It eliminates discomfort.  
It limits challenge.  
It filters honesty.  
It keeps the ego protected.

But it also keeps the leader weak.

The less connected they are to their people, the less grounded they become in reality. Their decisions drift. Their instincts dull. Their confidence becomes artificially inflated because no one close to them is allowed to tell the truth.

Servant leaders operate in the opposite direction.  
They do not hide behind structure — they move through it.  
They stay close to the work and the people doing it.  
They make themselves interruptible.  
They take questions directly.  
They allow others to challenge their thinking without fear of cost.

They know proximity doesn’t weaken authority — it strengthens trust.

Healthy leaders stay close enough to feel the culture, hear the tone, and understand the human impact of their decisions. They build a team that reflects shared ownership, not filtered loyalty. They do not outsource hard conversations or hide behind messengers.

They show up.

And because they show up, the culture grows stronger instead of thinner.

Isolation may create the illusion of power, but it always produces fragility.  
Presence creates the reality of leadership — and it produces resilience.

The best leaders aren’t the ones who stand above their teams.  
They’re the ones who stand among them.
