# “What are your values as a business leader?”

![What are your values as a business leader?](../images/what-are-your-values-as-a-business-leader.jpg)

That’s not a branding question. It’s a mirror question.  

Too many leaders have learned how to say the right things — how to perform empathy, how to script humility, how to make integrity sound poetic in a mission statement. But values aren’t words. They’re proof.  

If you say your people matter but never slow down to listen — your words are theater.  
If you talk about teamwork but reward self-preservation — your words are theater.  
If you preach transparency while hiding truth — your words are theater.  

Real leadership doesn’t need a script. It’s visible in how you treat people when no one’s watching. It’s the alignment between what you say and what your team actually experiences.  

So ask yourself:  

Are your values lived—or just performed?
