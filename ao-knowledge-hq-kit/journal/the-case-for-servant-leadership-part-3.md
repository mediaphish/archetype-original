# The Case for Servant Leadership

**Part 3**

**How Fear Sneaks In**

If the data explains what works, fear explains why so few leaders can actually live it out.

Fear is subtle. It rarely shows up as panic or paralysis. It hides inside urgency, performance, and control. It whispers, “If you don’t fix this, it all falls apart.” It’s efficient, persuasive, and convincing enough to make you believe it’s leadership. But fear is not leadership. It’s survival disguised as responsibility.

Science backs this up. When the brain detects threat—real or perceived—the amygdala takes over. Cortisol and adrenaline flood the system. The prefrontal cortex, which governs creativity, empathy, and reason, temporarily shuts down. That’s great for running from danger, terrible for leading people. It makes us reactive, defensive, and transactional.
Research from the NeuroLeadership Institute shows that leaders under chronic stress become less self-aware, less empathetic, and more controlling. UCLA’s studies on emotional contagion found that employees mirror the emotional tone of their leader within minutes. If the leader operates out of fear, the culture starts to as well. Fear scales faster than trust.

I know this firsthand.

After three decades in the digital world—building, leading, and growing teams I loved—my professional life came to an abrupt and painful stop. Everything I’d spent years creating vanished overnight. I carried the weight of that loss into a new chapter I never planned to write.

I had invested in a fitness company because I believed in the people. But when it began to spiral, I felt a responsibility to step in. The business was on the brink of collapse. The culture was fractured. And while I loved the people under those roofs, I wasn’t a fitness expert. This wasn’t my world. My first love had always been software.

But I couldn’t stand by and watch it fail.

So I led from fear. Not intentionally, but unavoidably.

Fear told me that if I didn’t fix everything fast, we’d lose it all. Fear told me that my worth depended on keeping it alive. Fear told me that the people depending on me couldn’t handle the truth about how tired I really was. So I pressed harder. I tried to control what couldn’t be controlled.

It looked like leadership. It felt like duty. But it was fear.

And like every form of fear-based leadership, it worked—until it didn’t. It kept the lights on. It stabilized things for a while. But it also took a toll. On my body. On my mind. On my faith. And it reminded me that even the best intentions can turn toxic when they’re powered by anxiety instead of conviction.

The lesson wasn’t about failure. It was about recognition. Servant leadership isn’t just a philosophy for when things are stable. It’s the antidote when everything is not. The act of serving others—protecting, empowering, and trusting them—is the only way to quiet fear’s voice in a leader’s head.

Fear leads us to grip tighter. Service forces us to open our hands.
The irony is that the people around us can usually feel our fear long before we admit it. Emotional contagion is real. Harvard Business Review found that a single anxious leader can raise stress levels across a team by up to 30% in one day. But the reverse is also true. Calm, servant-hearted leaders lower cortisol, increase trust, and invite creativity back into the room.

I didn’t learn that lesson from a book. I learned it in the storm.

Fear still knocks sometimes. But now, when it does, I don’t let it drive. I listen long enough to learn, then move forward with clarity. Because leadership isn’t about erasing fear—it’s about refusing to let it become your operating system.

If fear has been steering your leadership lately, it doesn’t mean you’ve failed. It means you’re human. But if you’re ready to lead with trust instead of tension, I can help. I mentor leaders and consult with teams who are ready to rebuild calm, clarity, and confidence into their culture.

Because the truth is simple: fear breaks things.
 Service builds them.
