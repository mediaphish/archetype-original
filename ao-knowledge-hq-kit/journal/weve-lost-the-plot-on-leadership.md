# We’ve Lost the Plot on Leadership.

![We’ve Lost the Plot on Leadership.](../images/weve-lost-the-plot-on-leadership.jpg)

Somewhere along the way, we started confusing leadership with power.

You can see it everywhere—  
In politics, where elected officials bark orders and build empires instead of serving their people.  
In business, where executives treat their teams like tools to be optimized instead of humans to be equipped.  
And yes, even in churches, where spiritual authority gets twisted into control.  

This isn’t leadership. It’s a power grab.  

Real leadership isn’t loud.  
It doesn’t demand the spotlight.  
It doesn’t hide behind titles or pull rank.  
It shows up, sleeves rolled up, ready to serve.  
That’s servant leadership—and it’s not soft. It’s not passive.  
It’s the most courageous, committed, and conviction-driven form of leadership there is.  

Some will say…  
“Servant leadership is too slow. Too weak. It won’t scale.”  
But here’s the truth:  

* Weak leadership uses people.  
* Strong leadership builds them.  

You want sustainable impact?  
You want real influence?  
Then build trust. Build people. Build culture.  

Because fear might produce short-term results—  
But service produces loyalty, transformation, and legacy.  

If we want a better future, we need better leaders.  

Not louder ones.  
Not richer ones.  
Not more charismatic ones.  

We need servant leaders.  
People who remember that influence is borrowed, not owed.  

That authority is a responsibility, not a right.  
And that leadership is not a platform for ego—  
It’s a place of sacrifice.  

Let’s raise the bar.  
Let’s return to the kind of leadership that serves first, speaks last, and never forgets who it’s really for.
