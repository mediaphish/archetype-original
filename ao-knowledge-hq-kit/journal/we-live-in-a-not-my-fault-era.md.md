# We live in a \'93not my fault\'94 era.\
\
![We live in a \'93not my fault\'94 era.](../images/we-live-in-a-not-my-fault-era.jpg)\
\
It\'92s not just cultural\'97it\'92s crept into business, leadership, and team dynamics.  \
\
Sales are down? Marketing\'92s fault.  \
Retention dropped? Must be bad clients.  \
Project failed? The timeline was too short.  \
Low morale? That\'92s on the staff.  \
No progress? \'93The economy\'85\'94  \
\
We\'92ve created a culture where the first instinct is blame.  \
\
But here\'92s the truth:  \
\
* Very little in business is completely out of your control.  \
* Every layer\'97from the CEO to the newest hire\'97has influence.  \
* Ownership is the only path forward.  \
\
If it happened on your watch, own it.  \
If a system failed, rebuild it.  \
If a person failed, coach them.  \
If you failed, admit it.  \
\
Here\'92s how to shift the mindset:  \
\
* Audit processes without pointing fingers. What actually broke?  \
* Start every review with \'93What could I/we have done differently?\'94  \
* Stop treating problems like enemies. They\'92re teachers.  \
* Hold others accountable by holding yourself accountable first.  \
* Say this out loud: \'93I\'92m responsible for the outcome, regardless of the excuse.\'94  \
\
Ownership is rare.  \
That\'92s why it stands out.  \
Be the person who leans in when others duck out.  \
