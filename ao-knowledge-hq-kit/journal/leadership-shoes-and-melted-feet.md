# Leadership, Shoes, and Melted Feet

![Leadership, Shoes, and Melted Feet](../images/leadership-shoes-and-melted-feet.jpg)

What started as a simple idea—two people swapping shoes to better understand each other—turned into an AI art disaster. One guy ended up with a half-melted foot jammed inside a broken sneaker.

At first, I was frustrated. But then it hit me:

When leaders and teams don’t understand each other, things get ugly fast.

Just like that cartoon.

We’ve got owners who forget what it’s like to be on the floor.  
And employees who forget what it takes to carry the weight of ownership.

The result? Miscommunication, resentment, burnout—and yeah, metaphorical melted feet.  
⸻  
What if we changed that?  
What if employees stepped up like they owned the place?  
What if owners slowed down and led with empathy?  

Here’s what that might look like:  

**Employees with an ownership mindset:**  
* Solve problems without being asked  
* Care about the company like it’s theirs  
* Protect the brand, not just the task list  

**Owners with an employee mindset:**  
* Remember what it’s like to feel unheard  
* Ask, not just tell  
* Lead with presence, not just pressure  
⸻  
We don’t need more rules—we need more understanding.  
And maybe a better cartoonist.  

Drop a comment: What would it look like for you to walk in the other person’s shoes?
