# LONE WOLVES DIE YOUNG

![LONE WOLVES DIE YOUNG](../images/lone-wolves-die-young.jpg)

There’s a myth that still gets passed around in leadership circles.  

The idea that real leaders go it alone.  
That strength is proven through isolation.  
That the “lone wolf” survives.  

But let’s stop pretending that’s true.  

In the wild, lone wolves have an annual death rate nearly four times higher than those in a pack. They’re more likely to starve, get injured, or die without protection. They’re not stronger. They’re just alone.  
And alone gets you killed.  

In business? Same pattern.  
* 50% of CEOs report feeling lonely.  
* 61% say that loneliness hurts their performance.  
* Leaders with “lone wolf” tendencies struggle to build buy-in, burn out faster, and fracture team culture.  

I’ve lived both sides of this.  

I was never happier in business than when I was surrounded by a team of amazing people that I had played a role in assembling.  
It was never lonely in that spot.  
It was community with purpose.  
It was beautiful—and the business was thriving. So was I.  

Leadership isn’t about standing above your people.  
It’s about building around you.  
It’s about supporting your team while you chase a goal together.  

The leader who wins alone… loses in the end.  

Survival is solo.  
Success is shared.  
Legacy is built in the pack.
