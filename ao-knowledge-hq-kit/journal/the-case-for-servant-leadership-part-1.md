# The Case for Servant Leadership

## Part 1

“The best teams don’t compete with each other. They complete each other.”

When everything I built came to an abrupt stop, I found myself sitting in silence with more questions than answers. My body was wrecked. My confidence was gone. My mind wouldn’t rest. I kept asking the same thing over and over: Did it matter? Did the sacrifices, the sleepless nights, the choice to put people first—did any of it add up to a legacy worth being proud of?

For nearly two years I wrestled with that question. I read, researched, and reflected. I studied what makes organizations thrive and what makes them collapse. What I found was both painful and freeing. There isn’t just one kind of leadership out there—there are many. Some are driven by ego and personal gain. Others by fear or insecurity. But one, one, stood out as the clear path to building something that can actually last: servant leadership.

And that realization wasn’t just philosophical—it was scientific.

The data confirmed what my gut always knew. Gallup found that teams rooted in trust and psychological safety outperform high-pressure cultures by up to 50% in productivity and 76% in engagement. MIT Sloan showed that collaborative cultures drive innovation by as much as 30%. The NeuroLeadership Institute proved that when people feel safe and valued, cortisol (the stress hormone) drops, and oxytocin rises—unlocking creativity, memory, and connection. Those numbers tell a story most leaders miss: fear gets you compliance, but trust gets you performance.

In my reflection, I also began to see these leadership patterns inside myself. I’ve led from strength. I’ve also led from exhaustion. I’ve led through calm, and at times, through fear. But the seasons where I led through service—when I protected my people, invested in their growth, and trusted them to rise—those were the seasons that flourished. Those were the teams that stayed together, innovated faster, and healed stronger.

I didn’t dig into all this research to prove anyone wrong. I did it to see if the way I led for 30 years still holds up in a world obsessed with performance. And it does. In fact, it’s more relevant now than ever. The logic holds. The data supports it. The results endure. Servant leadership isn’t weakness—it’s the ultimate form of strength under control. It’s the only leadership model that can sustain both human health and organizational excellence.

The best teams don’t compete. They complete. They see strength in others as an asset, not a threat. They share knowledge, celebrate wins, and hold each other accountable without fear. They protect the mission and the people. That’s not soft—that’s smart.

And if you’ve been wondering whether the way you led mattered, or if you’re leading right now and questioning whether it’s worth it to keep serving others first—I can tell you it is. I’ve lived it, lost it, rebuilt it, and proved it.

That’s what I do now. I mentor leaders who want to build trust instead of tension. I consult with teams and organizations who need to realign their culture, rebuild confidence, and restore clarity. Some engagements last a few sessions, others a few months, depending on what’s needed. Either way, it’s real work that gets real results.

If this resonates, and you're ready to make the shift—from pressure to purpose, from fear to trust, from competition to completion—reach out. Let's build something that lasts.
