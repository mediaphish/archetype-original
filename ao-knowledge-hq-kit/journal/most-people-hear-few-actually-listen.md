# Most people hear. Few actually listen.

![Most people hear. Few actually listen.](../images/most-people-hear-few-actually-listen.jpg)

Someone leaves a light on when they step out—just popping out and coming right back.  
But another person loses it:  

“Turn off that light! Are you trying to waste money or what?”  

Was that really about the light?  
No—just as Simon Sinek points out, surface reactions often stem from something deeper.  

> “Hearing is listening to what is said.  
> Listening is hearing what isn’t said.”  
> — Simon Sinek   

That yelling? It’s usually stress. Anxiety. Unresolved frustration—maybe even fear or exhaustion.  
As leaders, our challenge isn’t to demand compliance.  
It’s to see past the noise and connect with the person behind it.  

👂🏻 **Hearing** = You respond to what’s spoken: “Turn off the light!”  
🧠 **Listening** = You perceive the unspoken: “They’re worried, tired, or feeling unsafe.”  

Real leadership bridges the gap.  
It isn’t about shutting down behavior—it’s about shutting up and tuning in.  
Because hidden needs rarely come with neon signs.
