takeaways:
  - Narcissistic leaders use constant activity to avoid hard conversations and accountability.
  - Distraction keeps teams moving but never toward what actually needs to be dealt with.
  - Servant leaders stay with real problems long enough to understand them.
  - Clarity over time builds trust; constant pivots destroy it.

# The Distraction Play

Not every toxic leader shows up as obviously cruel or openly controlling. Some of them do something much quieter:

They keep everyone busy with the wrong things.

New ideas. New priorities. New “urgent” initiatives. New fires to put out. New conversations that feel important in the moment but somehow never move the work forward.

It all looks like momentum.  
It feels like progress.  
But if you step back and look at the pattern, you start to realize:

Nothing actually changes.

This is the distraction play.

In small businesses, it sounds like this:

“We’re going to completely rework our offer.”  
“We need a whole new brand direction.”  
“We’re pivoting our target market.”  
“We’re going all-in on this new idea.”

Sometimes those shifts are legitimate. Markets change. Strategy evolves. But under narcissistic leadership, these moves often happen at the exact same moments: right after hard feedback, right before accountability, or whenever something real is about to land on the leader’s lap.

In larger organizations, the distraction play shows up as never-ending initiatives. Task forces. Special projects. Re-orgs. Pilots. Reviews. Each one launched with energy and language about “alignment” or “transformation”—then quietly abandoned when it’s time to measure results or face uncomfortable truths.

The mechanism is simple:

If people are constantly reacting, they don’t have time to reflect.  
If they’re spread thin, they don’t have space to ask the right questions.  
If the conversation always shifts, the real issue never has a chance to stick.

The distraction play keeps everyone moving—but never toward the thing that actually needs to be dealt with.

You can see it in the timing.

A pattern of complaints about culture?  
Suddenly the focus shifts to “improving performance.”

Growing tension in the team?  
Now the priority is “tightening processes.”

Questions about the leader’s decisions?  
A brand-new idea gets dropped in the middle of the table—big enough to hijack attention, vague enough that no one can challenge it yet.

People walk away from these conversations exhausted but unresolved. They stay busy. They stay loyal. They stay slightly off-balance.

And that’s the point.

Psychologically, distraction is a way to avoid pain. For insecure leaders, it’s easier to stir up activity than to sit in a hard conversation, own a mistake, or confront a pattern in themselves. So they create noise. They inflate side issues. They elevate secondary problems. They make anything and everything a priority—except the one thing that would require them to change.

Over time, the cost to the team is heavy.

Focus fractures.  
Goals blur.  
People lose track of what matters.

You start hearing phrases like, “Didn’t we already try this?” or “What happened to the thing we said was critical three months ago?” Projects pile up half-finished. Strategies shift mid-stream. Metrics move, then get replaced, then disappear.

It’s not that the team can’t execute. It’s that the target never stops moving.

The distraction play also wears people down emotionally. When everything is always urgent and nothing is ever resolved, cynicism sets in. High performers learn not to fully invest, because they’ve learned that today's big initiative is tomorrow’s forgotten experiment.

The unspoken lesson becomes:

“Don’t take any of this too seriously. It’ll change again soon.”

That attitude is fatal to real progress.

Servant leaders work the other way around. They don’t chase constant novelty to avoid discomfort. They stay with the real problem long enough to understand it. They’re willing to sit in awkward conversations. They don’t run from unflattering data or feedback. They care more about substance than optics.

Instead of scattering attention, they narrow it.

They choose a few things that truly matter and keep returning to them, even when it’s not exciting. They resist the urge to redirect the conversation when it gets close to their own growth edges. They acknowledge when they’ve contributed to a problem instead of deflecting onto a new topic.

They understand that clarity over time is what builds trust.

In a healthy environment, new initiatives still happen—but they’re anchored. They fit inside a clear story. People understand how today’s efforts connect to last year’s commitments and next year’s direction. The work may be complex, but the purpose doesn’t bounce around.

You can feel the difference in the room.

Under the distraction play, meetings feel loud but hollow.  
Under focused, servant leadership, meetings feel steady and honest.

Under distraction, the leader leaves energized while everyone else feels drained.  
Under healthy leadership, the leader carries the weight with the team, not away from them.

The distraction play isn’t always malicious. Sometimes it’s just a scared leader trying not to look at something that hurts. But intent doesn’t change impact. A team constantly dragged from one focus to another will eventually lose its belief that anything real can be built here.

The leaders worth following don’t need constant movement to feel important. They don’t need fresh drama to stay relevant. They’re willing to do the quiet, repetitive, sometimes unglamorous work of staying with what matters.

They don’t use distraction to dodge accountability.  
They use attention to create change.

And when they choose that path long enough, something shifts:  
Busyness gives way to progress.  
Noise gives way to alignment.  
Activity gives way to impact.

The work doesn’t just look important.  
It starts to actually matter.
