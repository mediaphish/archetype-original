# The Proxy Trap

Some leaders rise on the strength of the people around them—not because they developed those people, but because they hide behind them. You don’t see it at first. From the outside, the team looks capable, productive, even impressive. But after a while, you start to notice something strange: the higher the expectations rise, the more invisible the leader becomes.

They aren’t driving the work.  
They’re riding it.

This is the proxy trap—when a leader depends on the competence of others to mask the gaps in their own.

You can see it play out in both small and large environments. In small businesses, it shows up quickly. A strong employee steps in to keep things moving, and the leader quietly lets them carry more than their share. The team begins to orbit around the high performer, not the person who technically holds authority. In larger organizations, the same pattern gets buried under titles and org charts. A department becomes known for excellence, but everyone knows the excellence comes from a few key contributors—not the person taking credit in the boardroom.

Narcissistic leaders love proxies because proxies make them look better than they are.

When things go well, they call it vision.  
When things fall apart, they call it execution.

Psychology explains this as self-enhancement bias—inflating your contribution and diminishing the contribution of others. Add a fragile ego to that bias, and you get a leader who doesn’t just misattribute success; they rely on others to create it.

The signs are subtle but consistent:

The most talented people in the room are always the busiest.  
Important decisions mysteriously “come from leadership,” even though leadership didn’t do the work.  
Press releases and announcements feature names that weren’t in the trenches.  
Promotions go to those who protect the narrative, not those who carry the load.  
High performers keep solving problems that aren’t theirs—not because they want to, but because no one else will.

Eventually, people start to notice that the leader’s contribution is mostly presentation. They show up for the big conversations, the big wins, the moments that earn admiration. But behind the scenes, someone else is carrying the weight.

This creates an unhealthy dynamic inside the team. The real leaders—the ones doing the thinking, the planning, the fixing—start feeling invisible. They carry responsibility without authority, and pressure without recognition. The formal leader becomes a bottleneck in every direction: information flows up to them for credit and down from them for blame.

Organizations running on proxy leadership experience predictable consequences:

High performers burn out.  
Mediocre performers become protective—they know their boss needs them, not because they’re good, but because they’re loyal.  
Average becomes acceptable because no one wants to overshadow the person at the top.  
The team stops growing because growth requires the real leader to actually lead.

Research on narcissistic leadership shows that these leaders often surround themselves with two kinds of people: high performers they can exploit and low performers they can control. The high performers do the work. The low performers affirm the leader’s ego. It’s a system designed to maintain image, not develop strength.

But there’s another cost people don’t talk about: the proxy leader never actually grows. They get used to outsourcing their gaps. They stop practicing essential skills because someone else always fills the void. And over time, they become the weakest person in every important conversation without even realizing it.

Servant leaders approach this differently. They don’t use people to cover their weaknesses—they work to close their own gaps. They recognize talent, but they don’t hide behind it. They develop it. They empower it. And when the moment comes to stand in front of a room, they tell the truth about where the heavy lifting really happened.

They understand something narcissistic leaders never learn: honoring the contributors doesn’t diminish you—it strengthens the entire team.

When leaders share credit freely, people step forward instead of stepping back.  
When they own the work and the weaknesses, trust grows.  
When they stop using people as shields, collaboration becomes real again.  
And when a leader refuses to ride the strength of others, something important happens: the team becomes stronger than its strongest individual.

Leadership isn’t proven by how much weight you can shift onto the people below you. It’s proven by how well you build others up without disappearing behind them.
