I recently gave a talk to a group of students who are likely to be the first in their families to attend college.

I didn’t give them a hype speech.

I gave them two mottos that have quietly shaped my entire life:

“I am second.”  
“Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.”

“I am second” means I consider everyone affected by the decisions I make — not just myself. It’s a posture of service. It’s a conscious choice to be unselfish. When something is at stake, I ask, “Who else does this impact?” Not, “What do I get out of it?”

“Slow is smooth” means if you rush, you create rework. Rework costs more time than discipline ever does. Precision compounds. Discipline compounds. Character compounds.

Those two ideas guided everything that followed.

In 1992, I was sitting in Carthage High School without a master plan. I started college chasing ideas — Political Science, then Architecture. Neither fit.

It took nearly three years before clarity showed up.

And when it did, it wasn’t dramatic. It was directional.

I chose Business. Studied Economics & Finance. Found the internet. And instead of drifting, I started aiming.

A newspaper job to learn layout.  
A campus website to learn development.  
Retail to learn sales and customer service.  
An accounting software company to understand systems.

I stacked skill.

That stack eventually turned into a software company — built without investors, grown client by client, year by year. At its peak, 104 people were on the team. We built real systems that real organizations depended on. After building it the steady way, I sold it.

Through that work, I found myself in rooms with national leaders, athletes, musicians, executives.

But that’s not the point.

The point is I didn’t come from a special place.

I had good parents.  
I took my education seriously.  

There was no secret advantage.  
No insider access.  
No extraordinary starting line.

What changed my trajectory wasn’t geography or luck.

It was discipline.  
It was direction.  
It was the daily choices most people overlook.

And even then, the greatest return wasn’t the company I built.

It wasn’t the revenue.  
It wasn’t the exit.

At some point, something shifted.

I stopped thinking about building something impressive.  
I started thinking about building people.

The greatest compliment I could ever receive isn’t about success.

It’s this:

“He helped me get better.”

None of the business milestones can hold a candle to that.

That’s the legacy I hope to leave behind.

But what I really wanted those students to hear wasn’t résumé highlights.

It was this:

The world outside school is not the world on your phone.

Social media isn’t real life.  
AI is a tool — not truth. Tools should challenge you, not merely affirm you.  
Real life is responsibility, pressure, bills, hard decisions.

And in that world, a few foundations matter more than hype.

Purpose anchors you when emotion tries to redirect you. When comparison creeps in. When frustration hits. Your why holds the line. Without it, you drift. With it, you endure.

Clarity doesn’t show up automatically. You chase it — through curiosity. Ask questions. Dig deeper. Don’t pretend to understand what you don’t. Confusion multiplies anxiety. Curiosity reduces it. The people who move forward aren’t the ones who know everything — they’re the ones willing to keep asking until they do.

Transparency builds trust — and trust is currency. People follow, promote, invest in, and protect those they trust. Transparency isn’t weakness; it’s alignment. It tells people exactly where they stand.

Consistency quietly outperforms raw talent. Talent gets attention. Reliability builds reputation. Showing up prepared, steady, and disciplined when others are emotional or distracted is a competitive advantage most people overlook.

Communication requires courage. Screens make everything easier — and weaker. Real influence still requires eye contact, listening, tone, and respectful disagreement. Adults who can communicate clearly are rare.

Failure is not identity; it’s information. Collapse often clarifies calling. SpaceX blew up rockets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. They’re glad they did. Every explosion revealed something that worked — and something that didn’t. Progress hides inside correction.

And finally, service.

Most of life is team life. You don’t have to be “the boss” to lead. When you help the people around you win, the environment stabilizes. And stability — not hype — is where long-term opportunity lives.

Before they left, I challenged them to do two things:

Have one real conversation.  
Serve one person intentionally.

Because when you build with purpose, move with discipline, and elevate the people around you, the future may not be easy —

But it can absolutely be bright.

Build it on purpose.
