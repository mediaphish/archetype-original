# The Pursuit of Power Corrupts

“Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

But the pursuit of power can corrupt just as much.

I once heard someone say, “With enough power, you can make people do anything.”

They didn’t have power yet — but their hunger for it was obvious.

They saw people as pawns, not teammates.

That mindset destroys trust, shatters culture, and breaks teams apart.
Leadership isn’t about chasing power.

It’s about carrying weight.

What Does It Mean to Carry Weight?

* Carrying weight means shouldering the responsibilities that come with guiding a team.
* It’s being there through personal and professional struggles.
* It’s making the tough decisions that put the team first.
* It’s owning your mistakes to set the example.
* It’s giving your team the tools and the space to grow.
* As a leader, you absorb the pressure — so your team can thrive.

The Power-Hungry Leader: Control Over Contribution

Power-hungry leaders are different.
* They chase status, not service.
* They micromanage, stifling creativity.
* They deflect blame to protect their image.
* They put personal gain above team success.

The result?

Toxic environments.

High turnover.

A team that doesn’t trust them — and eventually doesn’t follow them.

The Servant-Hearted Leader: Prioritizing the Human

After more than 30 years in business, I’ve learned:

True leadership prioritizes the human.

* It’s about seeing people as individuals — not just employees.
* It’s about helping them grow personally and professionally.
* When I led teams, my door was always open.
* Whether someone faced personal struggles or work challenges, they knew they could count on me to listen first — and guide second.
* By creating an environment where people felt seen and heard, I watched them grow into their best selves — at work and beyond.
* Servant-hearted leaders build trust through empathy.
* They foster holistic growth.
* They lift people higher than they could ever climb alone.

Power Isn’t the Answer

Some argue that power is essential to lead.

But power without purpose breeds control, not progress.

In my experience, when you prioritize the human — listening, supporting, uplifting — you create teams that are loyal, resilient, and driven.

Servant-hearted leaders don’t just carry weight.

They carry people.

Leadership Is Sacred

The pursuit of power can make us forget why we lead.

Let’s remember:

Leadership isn’t about control.

It’s about carrying the weight — with purpose, with people in mind, and with a servant’s heart.

How are you prioritizing the humans in your leadership today?
