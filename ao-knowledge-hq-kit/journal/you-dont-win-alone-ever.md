# You Don’t Win Alone. Ever.

Last week, I was watching the final games of the NFL regular season and realized I had plenty of time to think about things that weren’t really football—and if you know my team, you know exactly why.

That’s usually when my brain wanders.  
(And yes, this is where it wandered.)

It wasn’t stats or play calling. It was how obvious everything becomes when something breaks.

A coach without a **committed** team struggles to get a play off with any level of precision.  
A quarterback with no offensive line can’t set his feet, rushes the throw, and increases the odds of a bad decision.  
And now the wide receiver is trying to make a tough, contested catch that never needed to be that hard.

None of that guarantees failure.  
But it absolutely raises the chances.

One breakdown compounds the next. And pretty soon, people are blaming individuals for what is really a system under strain.

No one debates this in football. It’s just understood.

What’s interesting is how quickly that understanding disappears the moment we leave sports.

Outside the stadium, we suddenly pretend leadership is a solo act. One person. One vision. One hero dragging everyone else across the finish line.

Great story.  
Not even close to true.

The more I read, study, and honestly just pay attention to leadership patterns across business, organizations, and institutions, the clearer this becomes: outcomes almost never hinge on one exceptional person—no matter how badly we want them to.

Which is probably why the whole *“person on the cover of Forbes”* thing has always felt a little off to me.

Either they paid for it…  
or a whole lot of people did a whole lot of work to get them there.

I keep trying to think of a role where success actually happens in isolation. A real one. Not a hypothetical. And every time I go down that road, I end up right back here.

Founders don’t build companies alone.  
Athletes don’t win alone.  
Artists don’t create in a vacuum.  
Executives don’t execute anything by themselves.

Even the people we call “self-made” are standing on scaffolding they didn’t personally build.

Now here’s another thing I keep noticing — and this one usually shows up when things start going bad.

When organizations struggle, **two leadership patterns tend to emerge**.

The first is retreat.

Pressure hits. Numbers slide. Noise increases. And leadership pulls inward. Different rooms. Closed-door meetings. Smaller circles. Fewer voices. Decisions get made quietly… and delivered loudly.

They don’t call it hiding. They call it *focus*. Or *strategy*. Or *protecting the team while they figure it out*.

And look — I get the instinct. Pressure does weird things to people.

But what’s really happening is a kind of circling of the wagons. The leader feels the weight and decides they need to be the one to fix it. To carry it. To save it.

And the team feels that distance immediately.

The second pattern looks almost opposite.

Instead of shrinking the circle, the leader widens it. They bring more people in, not fewer. They ask more questions, not less. They stay closer to the work, not farther from it.

Not because it’s comfortable — it usually isn’t — but because they understand something important: pressure doesn’t make leadership simpler. It makes it more complex.

And complexity requires more perspective, not less.

That difference matters more than most people realize.

Because when leaders retreat, things get weird fast.

Decisions sound great on paper and fall apart in real life. Confidence goes up while context goes down. Feedback arrives late, filtered, or not at all. Everyone’s technically still on the same team… they’re just not anywhere near each other anymore.

That’s usually when the slide starts.

People don’t stop caring. They stop talking. They stop raising their hands. Not because they don’t have ideas — but because speaking up starts to feel risky.

On paper, the team still exists.  
In reality, it’s thinning out.

Which brings me back to the thing I keep circling.

I don’t think teams exist just to get more done. I think they exist to keep leaders grounded. To add friction when confidence starts outrunning truth.

That friction isn’t a problem — it’s a stabilizer. It slows leaders down just enough to keep vision connected to reality.

Way too many leaders run off with vision that sounds great but has already lost contact with the people doing the work. No resistance. No pushback. No one asking, “Are we sure?”

At that point, speed feels like progress.  
But it’s usually just drift.

Handled well, the friction of a real team becomes a gear, not a brake. It keeps things moving forward with strength and control. Pace without panic. Momentum without blind speed. Vision that actually holds together under pressure.

Ego doesn’t love that.

Ego likes clean lines. Fewer voices. Controlled access. It likes feeling important. After a while, insulation starts to feel like efficiency. Separation starts to feel like clarity.

It isn’t.

So here’s the simple answer to the question in the title — and yeah, it took me a while to get here.

Nothing meaningful gets done without a team.

Not vision.  
Not execution.  
Not resilience.  
Not recovery.

If someone truly believes they’re the exception… pass the popcorn. It’s probably going to look less like leadership and more like a NASCAR pileup on turn three.

Anyway — that’s what I kept thinking about while watching football that wasn’t going my way.

What do you think?
