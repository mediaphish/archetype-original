# I’ve spent some time purposely not writing.

![I’ve spent some time purposely not writing.](../images/ive-spent-some-time-purposely-not-writing.jpg)

Not because I had nothing to say—but because I needed space to think more deeply without the pressure to produce.

Lately, something’s been settling in my spirit.

For most of my life—business, fitness, leadership, even personal milestones—I’ve chased the summit.  
The finish line.  
The win.  

I used to believe that once I got there, I’d finally feel at peace. That I’d made it.  
But over time, I started noticing a pattern…  

Every time I reached a goal, it felt hollow. The feeling didn’t last. And worse—it never delivered what it promised.  

That’s the trap of the arrival fallacy—the lie that fulfillment is found at the end of a climb.  
But the truth? The “win” is usually just a transaction. It often means someone else had to lose. It’s typically quite selfish.  
It’s fleeting.  

Most of us aren’t pro athletes. We’re not playing for trophies.  
So why do we keep chasing life like it’s a game we’re trying to win?  

I’m learning that it was never about the summit.  
It was about the journey.  
It was about becoming.  

The real value—the real transformation—was in the struggle. The discipline. The process. The relationships forged along the way.  
That’s where purpose lives.  
That’s where growth happens.  
That’s where joy hides.  

So if you’re grinding for “the win,” I won’t tell you to stop. But I will tell you this:  

The win isn’t the goal. Becoming is.
