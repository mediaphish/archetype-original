## Scripture

**1 Corinthians 4:2**  
https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+4:2/

## Reflection

Leadership often tempts people toward ownership rather than stewardship. When leaders view their role as ownership, they protect territory, resist change, and measure success by control. Scripture calls leaders to something different: faithfulness in what has been entrusted, not dominance over what is held.

Stewardship shifts the focus from possession to care. Servant leaders understand that influence, authority, and opportunity are entrusted temporarily and must be handled responsibly. This perspective frees leaders from ego-driven decisions and aligns leadership with long-term impact rather than short-term gain.

Faithful stewardship asks a different question—not “What can I get from this?” but “What has been entrusted to me, and how do I care for it well?”

## Practical Application

- Reflect on an area where you may be acting like an owner instead of a steward.
- Ask how your decisions affect people beyond immediate outcomes.
- Choose faithfulness over control in one decision today.

## Takeaways

- Leadership is a trust, not a possession.
- Faithfulness matters more than visibility or control.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead as a faithful steward, not an owner.
