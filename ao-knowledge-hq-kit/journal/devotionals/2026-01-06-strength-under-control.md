## Scripture

**James 4:6**

---

## Reflection

Strength without humility eventually becomes harmful. Scripture does not reject strength—it redirects it. Humility is not weakness; it is strength exercised with awareness and restraint. Leaders who resist humility often confuse authority with infallibility, creating distance between themselves and those they lead.

Servant leadership requires strength that serves rather than dominates. When leaders embrace humility, they gain credibility, invite feedback, and create space for growth. Strength under control protects people instead of intimidating them.

---

## Practical Application

- Identify where you may be asserting strength instead of practicing humility.
- Invite one piece of honest feedback from a trusted voice.
- Use your authority today to protect or elevate someone else.

---

## Takeaways

- Humility strengthens leadership credibility.
- Controlled strength builds trust.

---

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with strength that serves, not strength that demands.
