## Scripture

**Ephesians 2:10**

---

## Reflection

A renewed season doesn’t begin with striving—it begins with remembering purpose. Scripture frames good work as something prepared in advance, not something leaders must invent or prove. That matters because leadership pressure often turns calling into performance. When that happens, leaders begin chasing validation instead of serving people.

Servant leadership flows from identity, not insecurity. Leaders who understand they were created for meaningful work can release the need to control outcomes or impress others. They stop asking, How do I look? and start asking, Who does this serve? Renewal, in this sense, is not about doing more—it’s about returning to why you lead at all.

## Practical Application

- Identify one area where you’ve been performing instead of stewarding.
- Ask what work you may be forcing rather than faithfully carrying.
- Choose one action today that aligns with purpose rather than pressure.

---

## Takeaways

- Purpose precedes performance.
- Leadership rooted in identity produces healthier outcomes.

## Closing Thought

Today I lead from calling, not from the need to prove myself.
