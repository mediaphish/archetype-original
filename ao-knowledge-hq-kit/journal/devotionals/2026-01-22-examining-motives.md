## Scripture

**Colossians 3:23–24 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Colossians+3:23-24/

## Reflection

Leadership decisions are often shaped by unseen motives. Even good actions can be driven by the desire for approval, control, or recognition. Scripture redirects attention beneath behavior to the heart, reminding leaders that their work is ultimately carried out before God, not an audience.

When motives drift, leadership becomes exhausting. Leaders begin managing perception instead of stewarding responsibility. Re-centering work around faithfulness rather than visibility frees leaders from performance pressure and restores clarity of purpose.

Servant leadership endures when leaders regularly examine why they do what they do, not just what they are doing.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on what is motivating your current leadership decisions.
- Identify where external validation may be influencing your actions.
- Choose one responsibility today and carry it faithfully, regardless of recognition.

## Takeaways

- Motives shape sustainability.
- Faithfulness matters more than approval.

## Closing Thought

Today I lead from faithfulness rather than the need to impress.
