## Scripture

**Matthew 11:28–30 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Matthew+11:28-30/

## Reflection

Leadership has a way of slowly replacing identity with responsibility. Scripture offers a different invitation—one of rest, humility, and restoration. Jesus does not call leaders to escape responsibility, but to lay down the weight that was never meant to define them.

Love plays a quiet but critical role in that return. Love that restores leaders does not demand more. It reminds them who they are apart from outcomes, performance, or pressure. It creates space for rest, reflection, and truth when leadership has narrowed perspective.

Jesus speaks of a yoke that is easy and a burden that is light—not because leadership lacks weight, but because it is carried rightly. Leaders who allow themselves to be restored lead differently. They listen better. They react less. They lead from groundedness rather than exhaustion.

Relational faithfulness continues here. Love does not consume leaders—it restores them.

## Practical Application

- Notice where leadership pressure has narrowed your perspective.
- Allow rest and support to reorient you.
- Lead from wholeness rather than depletion.

## Takeaways

- Love restores leaders, not just those they lead.
- Restored leaders lead with clarity and care.

## Closing Thought

Today I will allow love to restore me, not just sustain me.
