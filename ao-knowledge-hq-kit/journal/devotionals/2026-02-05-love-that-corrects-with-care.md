## Scripture

**Proverbs 27:5–6 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+27:5-6/

## Reflection

Love in leadership does not avoid hard conversations. It approaches them with care. Scripture reminds leaders that faithful correction is not an act of harm, but of commitment. Silence may feel kind in the moment, but love that refuses to speak truth ultimately withholds what others need to grow.

Correction shaped by love is neither harsh nor hesitant. It is thoughtful, measured, and grounded in responsibility. Leaders who love well prepare their words, consider timing, and speak with the goal of restoration rather than control. The aim is not to win the moment, but to strengthen the relationship.

When correction is driven by frustration, it wounds. When correction is driven by love, it forms. People trust leaders who are willing to speak truth carefully and consistently, even when it is uncomfortable.

Relational faithfulness requires courage. Love does not abandon people to avoid tension—it walks with them through it.

## Practical Application

- Identify a conversation you've delayed out of discomfort.
- Prepare to speak truth with clarity and care.
- Lead the conversation with restoration as the goal.

## Takeaways

- Love corrects to restore, not to control.
- Faithful leadership requires courage and care.

## Closing Thought

Today I will speak truth with love and responsibility.
