## Scripture

**Matthew 5:23–24 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Matthew+5:23-24/

## Reflection

Love in leadership does not avoid tension. Scripture teaches that reconciliation requires movement. Love does not wait for the other person to fix it first.

Avoidance often disguises itself as patience. In reality, it can be fear. Leaders who love faithfully step toward conflict with humility, not aggression. They seek clarity, not victory.

Moving toward conflict does not guarantee easy outcomes. It does demonstrate courage. Love does not protect ego; it protects relationship.

Relational faithfulness is strengthened here. Love closes distance instead of increasing it.

## Practical Application

- Identify a conversation you've been postponing.
- Initiate it with humility and clarity.
- Seek resolution rather than being proven right.

## Takeaways

- Love moves toward reconciliation.
- Courage strengthens relationships.

## Closing Thought

Today I will move toward conflict with love, not away from it.
