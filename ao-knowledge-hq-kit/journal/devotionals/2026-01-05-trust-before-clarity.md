## Scripture

**Proverbs 3:5–6**

---

## Reflection

Leaders often want certainty before commitment. Scripture presents the opposite pattern: trust first, direction later. This does not excuse irresponsibility, but it does challenge the belief that leaders must see everything before they move. Dependence, not certainty, becomes the foundation for faithful leadership.

Servant leadership accepts that clarity often unfolds after obedience. Leaders who insist on total understanding before acting frequently stall progress or default to control. Trust reframes leadership from managing outcomes to stewarding decisions—doing the next right thing without demanding the full picture.

## Practical Application

- Identify a decision you are delaying in search of certainty.
- Clarify what you already know to be wise and responsible.
- Take the next faithful step without demanding full resolution.

---

## Takeaways

- Trust often precedes clarity.
- Dependence reduces fear-driven leadership.

## Closing Thought

Today I will trust God with what I cannot see and act faithfully on what I can.
