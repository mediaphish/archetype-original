## Scripture

**James 1:19–20 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/James+1:19-20/

## Reflection

Leadership often rewards speed—decisiveness, clarity, momentum. But Scripture places listening before speaking and restraint before action. Love in leadership is revealed not by how quickly a leader responds, but by how carefully they receive what others are trying to say.

Biblical love does not rush to be heard. It creates space. It listens without defensiveness and without rehearsing the next move. Leaders shaped by love understand that anger—even when disguised as passion or urgency—narrows understanding and weakens discernment. It may feel productive in the moment, but it rarely produces what God desires.

Listening is not passive leadership. It is disciplined leadership. It requires humility, patience, and self-control. When leaders listen first, people feel seen rather than managed. Trust grows not because leaders agree with everything they hear, but because they are willing to receive others fully before responding.

Relational faithfulness shows up here. Love slows leaders down long enough to understand, not just react.

## Practical Application

- Pause before responding in a conversation that feels tense or urgent.
- Ask one clarifying question before offering direction or correction.
- Practice restraint when emotion rises—choose understanding over reaction.

## Takeaways

- Love listens before it leads.
- Self-control preserves discernment and trust.

## Closing Thought

Today I will listen with patience and lead with restraint.
