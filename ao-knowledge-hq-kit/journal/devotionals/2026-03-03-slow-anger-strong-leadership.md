## Scripture

**Proverbs 14:29 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+14:29/

## Reflection

Scripture connects slow anger with great understanding. Quick temper with folly. Leadership often tempts toward speed—quick judgment, quick correction, quick reaction.

Slow anger does not mean weak conviction. It means measured response. Leaders who are slow to anger think clearly and act intentionally.

Reactive leadership escalates tension. Measured leadership diffuses it. Steadfast leaders understand that authority does not require volatility.

Strength is revealed not in how quickly you react, but in how wisely you respond.

## Practical Application

- Delay your response in your next frustrating moment.
- Seek understanding before correction.
- Refuse to let irritation dictate tone.

## Takeaways

- Slowness in anger produces clarity.
- Measured response strengthens leadership.

## Closing Thought

Today I will respond with strength, not speed.
