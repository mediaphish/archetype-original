## Scripture

**2 Timothy 4:7 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+4:7/

## Reflection

Leadership love is not only measured by how it begins, but by how it finishes. Scripture records Paul's words near the end of his life: he fought the good fight, finished the race, and kept the faith. Faithful completion reflects enduring love.

Many leaders begin with passion. Fewer finish with steadiness. Love sustains commitment beyond emotion. It carries responsibility through fatigue, tension, and long seasons of unseen effort.

Finishing well does not mean perfection. It means faithfulness. It means staying aligned with conviction, honoring commitments, and remaining consistent even when excitement fades.

Relational faithfulness culminates here. Love does not abandon what it once embraced.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on a commitment you are responsible to complete.
- Identify where weariness may be tempting you to withdraw.
- Recommit to finishing faithfully rather than exiting prematurely.

## Takeaways

- Love finishes what it starts.
- Faithful completion builds lasting trust.

## Closing Thought

Today I will finish faithfully what love has called me to begin.
