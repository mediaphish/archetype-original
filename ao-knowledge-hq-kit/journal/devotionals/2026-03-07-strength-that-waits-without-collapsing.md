## Scripture

**Isaiah 40:29–31 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+40:29-31/

## Reflection

Scripture reminds us that God gives power to the faint and increases strength to the one who feels they have none left. Even the young grow weary. Even the strong eventually stumble. Leadership does not exempt anyone from exhaustion. It only magnifies it.

Steadiness is not the absence of fatigue. It is the refusal to surrender to it prematurely. The prophet Isaiah does not describe frantic effort as the source of endurance. He describes waiting. Those who wait for the Lord renew their strength.

Waiting is not passive. It is anchored dependence. It is the quiet decision to trust before forcing a result. Leaders who learn to wait are not weaker. They are more sustainable.

The world celebrates relentless pace. Scripture celebrates renewed strength. When leaders wait instead of pushing beyond their limits, they rise with wings like eagles. They run without burning out. They walk without collapsing under hidden pressure.

Steadfast leadership is not driven by adrenaline. It is fueled by renewal.

## Practical Application

- Identify where you are pushing beyond healthy limits.
- Pause before accelerating further.
- Anchor your strength in dependence rather than force.

## Takeaways

- Renewed strength sustains leadership.
- Waiting produces endurance.

## Closing Thought

Today I will wait for renewed strength rather than forcing momentum.
