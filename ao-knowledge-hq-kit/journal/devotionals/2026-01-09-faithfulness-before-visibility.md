## Scripture

**Luke 16:10**

---

## Reflection

Leadership culture often celebrates visibility, influence, and recognition. Scripture emphasizes something quieter: faithfulness. Small, unseen responsibilities shape character long before leadership influence becomes public. Leaders who overlook this truth often chase visibility without cultivating trustworthiness.

Servant leadership is built in private before it is displayed in public. Faithfulness in small things trains leaders to handle greater responsibility with humility and care. What seems insignificant today may be preparing you for tomorrow’s assignment.

## Practical Application

- Identify a responsibility you’ve been tempted to minimize or rush.
- Approach it today with intentional care and consistency.
- Resist the urge to seek recognition for quiet faithfulness.

---

## Takeaways

- Faithfulness forms leadership character.
- Small responsibilities shape future influence.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead faithfully, even when no one is watching.
