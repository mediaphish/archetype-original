## Scripture

**Luke 16:10 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Luke+16:10/

## Reflection

Leadership culture often celebrates visibility and scale, but Scripture emphasizes consistency in small responsibilities. What appears ordinary or insignificant frequently shapes character more deeply than moments of influence or recognition.

Servant leaders understand that attention to small things is not beneath them. Faithfulness in everyday responsibilities trains leaders to handle greater trust with care and integrity. Over time, consistency builds credibility that visibility alone cannot.

Leadership strength is often formed long before it is noticed.

## Practical Application

- Identify a routine responsibility you’ve been tempted to overlook.
- Carry it well today, even if no one notices.
- Practice consistency rather than seeking significance.

## Takeaways

- Small responsibilities shape character.
- Consistency builds long-term trust.

## Closing Thought

Today I lead faithfully in what has been entrusted to me.
