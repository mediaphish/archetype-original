## Scripture

**Proverbs 19:2**

## Reflection

Speed often masquerades as decisiveness in leadership. Scripture warns that action without knowledge leads to missteps rather than progress. Leaders under pressure may feel compelled to move quickly to demonstrate confidence, but haste frequently sacrifices clarity and discernment.

Servant leadership values wisdom over urgency. Slowing down is not avoidance; it is stewardship. Leaders who pause long enough to seek understanding make fewer corrective decisions later and build greater trust with those they lead.

Renewal includes learning when speed helps—and when it harms.

## Practical Application

- Identify a decision you feel rushed to make.
- Ask what additional understanding or perspective might be needed.
- Choose clarity over immediacy today.

## Takeaways

- Speed does not equal wisdom.
- Discernment protects leaders from unnecessary correction.

## Closing Thought

Today I choose wisdom over haste in my leadership.
