## Scripture

**Colossians 3:23–24**

## Reflection

Leadership is often measured in moments of visibility—decisions made in meetings, outcomes announced publicly, results that can be pointed to. Scripture redirects attention to something far less dramatic: faithfulness in ordinary work.

What leaders do consistently, quietly, and without recognition shapes culture more than isolated moments of excellence. When ordinary responsibilities are treated as meaningful, people feel respected rather than used. Faithfulness communicates that the work—and the people doing it—matter, even when no one is watching.

Servant leadership is practiced long before it is noticed. It shows up in preparation, follow-through, and care taken in details that seem small but accumulate over time.

## Practical Application

- Identify one ordinary responsibility you’ve been tempted to rush or dismiss.
- Approach it today with care and intentionality.
- Model consistency so others know what faithfulness looks like in practice.

## Takeaways

- Faithfulness is formed in ordinary moments.
- Consistency builds trust more than visibility.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead faithfully in the work set before me.
