## Scripture

**1 Corinthians 16:14 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+16:14/

## Reflection

Leadership love is often measured by visible sacrifice, but Scripture also honors the quieter work of endurance. Love expressed through ordinary faithfulness sustains leadership over time.

Endurance is not dramatic. It shows up in consistency, patience, and showing up again when recognition is absent. Leaders shaped by love do not require constant affirmation to remain faithful.

Scripture calls leaders to let everything be done in love—not just the moments that feel meaningful. Ordinary faithfulness, practiced daily, forms cultures that are steady rather than reactive.

Relational faithfulness deepens here. Love does not burn hot and disappear—it remains.

## Practical Application

- Identify one ordinary responsibility you've grown weary of.
- Recommit to faithfulness without seeking recognition.
- Serve steadily, even when the work feels routine.

## Takeaways

- Love endures through consistency.
- Faithfulness over time builds trust.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with love that endures.
