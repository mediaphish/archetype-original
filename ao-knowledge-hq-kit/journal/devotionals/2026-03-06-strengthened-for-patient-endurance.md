## Scripture

**Ephesians 6:10–11 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+6:10-11/

## Reflection

Scripture calls leaders to be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.

Strength is not sourced from personality. It is drawn from dependence. Steadfast leadership recognizes that endurance requires reinforcement.

Putting on the whole armor of God is not dramatic. It is daily preparation. Leaders who prepare quietly withstand pressure steadily.

Endurance is sustained by strength borrowed from the Lord, not manufactured from pride.

## Practical Application

- Begin your day by consciously depending on God's strength.
- Identify areas where you are relying only on yourself.
- Prepare spiritually before reacting professionally.

## Takeaways

- Strength is supplied through dependence.
- Preparation precedes endurance.

## Closing Thought

Today I will draw strength from the Lord to remain steady.
