## Scripture

**James 1:19–20 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/James+1:19-20/

## Reflection

Renewal often begins not with new action, but with renewed attention. Scripture places listening before speaking and restraint before reaction. Leaders are reminded that attentiveness is not passive—it is a disciplined posture that shapes how power and influence are exercised.

Verse 20 provides essential context. Unchecked anger does not produce the righteousness God desires. When leaders act from impatience, defensiveness, or emotional reactivity, they often undermine trust and clarity. Renewal requires leaders to address internal responses before external decisions.

Servant leadership listens first, responds thoughtfully, and acts without being driven by frustration. This posture renews leadership not by increasing activity, but by improving discernment and restraint.

## Practical Application

- Identify a situation where frustration has influenced your response.
- Practice listening fully before reacting.
- Choose restraint so your leadership produces the right outcomes.

## Takeaways

- Renewal begins with disciplined attention.
- Restraint protects leadership effectiveness.

## Closing Thought

Today I renew my leadership by listening first and responding with restraint.
