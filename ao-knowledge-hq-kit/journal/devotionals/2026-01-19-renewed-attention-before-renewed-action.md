## Scripture

**James 1:19 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/James+1:19/

## Reflection

Renewal often begins not with new action, but with renewed attention. Leadership culture rewards speed and decisiveness, but Scripture places listening first. Being “quick to hear” is not passive—it is disciplined restraint that resets how leaders engage the world around them.

When leaders fail to listen, they often act on assumptions rather than reality. Renewal of leadership attention slows this impulse. Servant leaders listen not to confirm their own thinking, but to understand people, context, and consequence. This renewed posture changes the quality of decisions long before outcomes are visible.

Listening before leading is one of the simplest—and most overlooked—ways leaders renew their effectiveness.

## Practical Application

- Identify one situation where you tend to move too quickly.
- Practice listening without preparing your response.
- Allow renewed attention to shape your next decision.

## Takeaways

- Renewal begins with how leaders listen.
- Understanding precedes wise leadership action.

## Closing Thought

Today I renew my leadership by listening before I lead.
