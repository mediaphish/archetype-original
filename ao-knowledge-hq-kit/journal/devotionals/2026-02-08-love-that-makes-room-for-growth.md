## Scripture

**Colossians 1:9–10 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Colossians+1:9-10/

## Reflection

Leadership love does not force growth on a timeline driven by pressure or impatience. Scripture points leaders toward a posture that nurtures growth through wisdom, understanding, and steady encouragement. Love creates space for development rather than demanding immediate outcomes.

When leaders rush growth, people often retreat or perform. But when leaders make room for growth, people are given permission to learn, struggle, and mature honestly. This kind of leadership love trusts the process rather than controlling it.

Making room for growth requires restraint. Leaders must resist the urge to over-direct or over-correct. Instead, they guide, support, and allow others to take responsibility appropriate to their season.

Relational faithfulness is expressed here. Love believes growth is worth the time it requires.

## Practical Application

- Identify where you may be rushing someone's development.
- Adjust expectations to support sustainable growth.
- Encourage progress without demanding perfection.

## Takeaways

- Love makes room for growth.
- Faithful leadership values process over speed.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with patience that allows others to grow.
