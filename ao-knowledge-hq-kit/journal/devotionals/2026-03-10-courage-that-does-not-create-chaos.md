## Scripture

**Deuteronomy 31:6 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+31:6/

## Reflection

Scripture commands strength and courage, grounding both in the promise that the Lord goes with His people. Courage in leadership is often misunderstood as bold personality or visible intensity. Scripture presents it differently.

True courage is steady. It is rooted in presence rather than performance. When leaders believe they are not alone, they act decisively without becoming reactive.

Steadfast courage does not generate chaos. It stabilizes uncertainty. Teams look to leaders for emotional cues. When courage is loud and volatile, anxiety spreads. When courage is calm and anchored, confidence grows.

The Lord's nearness is the foundation of this steadiness. Leaders do not need to manufacture bravery. They need to remember who walks with them.

Courage that is grounded in presence produces stability that others can trust.

## Practical Application

- Identify one decision you have delayed out of fear.
- Act with calm conviction.
- Anchor your courage in God's promise of presence.

## Takeaways

- Courage is rooted in God's nearness.
- Calm conviction builds team confidence.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with courage that stabilizes rather than unsettles.
