## Scripture

**Proverbs 27:2**

## Reflection

Leadership culture often rewards self-promotion. Scripture offers a counterweight: humility that allows recognition to come from others rather than being demanded or manufactured.

Humility is not self-denial or passivity. It is strength under control. Leaders who practice humility create space for others to be seen and valued. They resist the urge to claim credit and instead focus on shared success.

Servant leadership understands that recognition pursued too aggressively erodes trust. Recognition received naturally reinforces credibility. Humility protects leaders from becoming the center of the story when they were never meant to be.

## Practical Application

- Notice where you may be tempted to highlight your own contribution.
- Practice letting others receive credit today.
- Lead with confidence that does not require validation.

## Takeaways

- Humility strengthens leadership credibility.
- Shared recognition builds healthier cultures.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with humility, allowing others to be seen.
