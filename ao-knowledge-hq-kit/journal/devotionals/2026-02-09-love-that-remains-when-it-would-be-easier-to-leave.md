## Scripture

**Ruth 1:16–17 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Ruth+1:16-17/

## Reflection

Leadership love is most clearly revealed when commitment becomes inconvenient. Scripture honors love that remains—love that stays present even when circumstances invite withdrawal. This kind of faithfulness is not driven by obligation alone, but by covenantal commitment.

Remaining present when it would be easier to leave requires courage and resolve. Leaders who love faithfully do not disengage at the first sign of difficulty. They stay, listen, support, and carry responsibility even when outcomes are uncertain.

This form of leadership love creates deep trust. People remember who stayed when things were hard. Faithfulness under pressure leaves a lasting imprint on relationships and culture.

Relational faithfulness finds its deepest expression here. Love remains because people matter more than ease.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on a situation where disengagement feels tempting.
- Choose faithfulness over convenience in that moment.
- Reaffirm commitment through consistent presence.

## Takeaways

- Love remains when leadership becomes costly.
- Faithfulness builds trust that endures.

## Closing Thought

Today I will remain faithful, even when it would be easier to leave.
