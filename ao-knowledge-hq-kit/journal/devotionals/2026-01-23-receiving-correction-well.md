## Scripture

**Proverbs 12:1 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+12:1/

## Reflection

Leadership roles can quietly harden people against correction. Authority and experience may create the illusion that growth is no longer necessary. Scripture challenges this assumption, framing instruction as a pathway to wisdom rather than a threat to competence.

Leaders who resist correction often stagnate. Those who receive it well remain grounded, adaptable, and credible. Servant leadership depends on humility—not as self-deprecation, but as openness to refinement.

How leaders respond to correction often determines whether growth continues or stalls.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on how you typically respond when challenged or corrected.
- Revisit a recent piece of feedback you may have dismissed too quickly.
- Practice listening today without defending or deflecting.

## Takeaways

- Teachability sustains leadership growth.
- Humility keeps leaders grounded.

## Closing Thought

Today I will receive correction as an opportunity to grow.
