## Scripture

**Mark 9:35 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Mark+9:35/

## Reflection

Leadership often gravitates toward visibility. Influence is measured by recognition, impact by acknowledgment. But love expressed through leadership is often most faithful when it goes unnoticed. Scripture reframes greatness not as prominence, but as service—especially service that does not require affirmation to remain faithful.

Love that serves without being seen resists the need for validation. It shows up consistently, carries responsibility quietly, and does not measure worth by response or applause. This kind of leadership love is not passive. It is intentional restraint—the choice to serve because it is right, not because it is rewarded.

When leaders require recognition, service becomes transactional. But when leaders are shaped by love, service becomes formative. Others are strengthened not by the leader's visibility, but by their faithfulness.

Relational faithfulness deepens here. Love serves because people matter, not because the moment is visible.

## Practical Application

- Perform one act of service today without signaling or explaining it.
- Resist the urge to measure impact by recognition.
- Serve faithfully even when no feedback is given.

## Takeaways

- Love serves without needing to be seen.
- Faithful leadership does not depend on affirmation.

## Closing Thought

Today I will serve faithfully without seeking recognition.
