## Scripture

**Hebrews 6:10 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Hebrews+6:10/

## Reflection

Scripture reminds us that God is not unjust. He does not overlook the work done in His name or the love shown toward His people. Hebrews anchors leadership in a powerful truth: love expressed through service is seen, remembered, and honored by God.

In leadership, growth is often slow and unseen. Faithful labor can feel unnoticed. Effort given in love may not always receive public affirmation. Scripture corrects that discouragement. What is done in love is never wasted.

Leaders who rejoice in faithful labor create cultures where steady service matters. They do not only celebrate visible wins or dramatic success. They recognize endurance, consistency, and quiet commitment.

Love in leadership finds joy not merely in outcomes, but in faithfulness itself. It honors the work, the effort, and the growth that unfolds over time.

Relational faithfulness deepens here. Love rejoices because it sees service as sacred, not transactional.

## Practical Application

- Acknowledge someone's faithful service that may go unnoticed.
- Express gratitude for effort, not just achievement.
- Reframe unseen labor as meaningful rather than overlooked.

## Takeaways

- Love honors faithful service.
- What is done in love is never wasted.

## Closing Thought

Today I will rejoice in faithful labor, knowing that love sees what others may not.
