## Scripture

**Mark 2:27**

## Reflection

Rest is often treated as a reward for productivity rather than a requirement for faithfulness. Scripture reframes rest as something given *for* people, not something that limits them. For leaders, this challenges the belief that constant availability and output are signs of commitment.

Servant leadership recognizes that exhaustion distorts judgment. When leaders ignore rest, they often lead reactively instead of wisely. Rest becomes an act of trust—trust that the work does not depend entirely on personal effort and that stepping back does not equal abandonment of responsibility.

Renewal includes learning when to stop.

- Establish a boundary today that protects margin or recovery.

---

## Takeaways

- Rest is a leadership discipline, not a luxury.
- Sustainable leadership requires trust beyond effort.

## Closing Thought

Today I honor God and those I lead by choosing healthy rest.
