## Scripture

**2 Corinthians 5:16–17**

## Reflection

Paul is not talking about incremental improvement. He is describing a fundamental shift in identity and perspective. To be made new in Christ means we no longer see ourselves—or others—through the same lenses we once did. Old measures of worth, success, and power lose their authority. A new framework takes their place.

For leaders, this is where renewal begins. Leadership does not start with refining techniques; it starts with reorienting vision. When leaders adopt a renewed way of seeing, they stop leading from ego, fear, or performance and begin leading from purpose and conviction. New leadership does not emerge because circumstances change—it emerges because perspective does.

This is not about forgetting the past. It is about refusing to let the past define the future.
