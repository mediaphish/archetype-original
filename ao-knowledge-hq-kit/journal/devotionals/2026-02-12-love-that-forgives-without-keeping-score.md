## Scripture

**Matthew 18:21–22 (ESV)**

---

## Reflection

Leadership love is tested by offense. Scripture calls leaders to forgive not as a one-time gesture, but as a posture that resists keeping score. Forgiveness does not erase responsibility, but it refuses to let past wrongs dictate future posture.

When leaders keep score, relationships become strained and guarded. Trust erodes under unspoken debt. But when leaders forgive faithfully, space is created for restoration, learning, and renewed commitment.

Forgiveness does not mean ignoring patterns or avoiding boundaries. It means releasing resentment and choosing to lead without bitterness shaping decisions. Love leads forward rather than anchoring itself to past harm.

Relational faithfulness is sustained here. Love refuses to let offense define the relationship.

## Practical Application

---

## Takeaways

- Love forgives without keeping score.
- Freedom grows when resentment is released.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with forgiveness that frees both others and myself.
