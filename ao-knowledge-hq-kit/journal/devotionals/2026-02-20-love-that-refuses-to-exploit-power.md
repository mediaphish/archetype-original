## Scripture

**Mark 10:42–45 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Mark+10:42-45/

## Reflection

Scripture is unambiguous about power. Jesus contrasts the way authority is often used with the way it is meant to be carried. Leadership love refuses to exploit position, influence, or advantage for personal gain.

Exploited power may achieve results, but it leaves damage behind. Love-driven leadership chooses service over self-preservation. It uses authority to lift, not leverage; to protect, not extract.

Leaders who love faithfully remain aware of the imbalance power creates. They act with restraint, humility, and accountability, knowing that trust is fragile and easily abused.

Relational faithfulness deepens here. Love does not use people—it serves them.

## Practical Application

- Examine how power shows up in your leadership role.
- Identify where restraint is needed.
- Choose service over self-interest in one concrete decision today.

## Takeaways

- Love carries power with humility.
- Authority is given to serve, not to exploit.

## Closing Thought

Today I will use authority to serve, not to elevate myself.
