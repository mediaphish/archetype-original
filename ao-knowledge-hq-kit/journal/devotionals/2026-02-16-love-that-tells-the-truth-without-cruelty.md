## Scripture

**Ephesians 4:15 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+4:15/

## Reflection

Love in leadership does not avoid truth. Scripture calls leaders to speak truth, but never detached from love. Truth delivered without care wounds. Love delivered without truth misleads. Faithful leadership holds both together.

Leaders who love well do not weaponize honesty. They understand that truth is meant to build, not humiliate. Speaking truth requires discernment—knowing not only what to say, but how and when to say it.

Cruelty often disguises itself as boldness. Scripture exposes that false strength. Love speaks plainly, but with restraint. It corrects without shaming and confronts without tearing down.

Relational faithfulness shows up here. Love refuses to trade kindness for control.

## Practical Application

- Consider a truth you need to communicate soon.
- Examine your motive before you speak.
- Choose words that clarify rather than crush.

## Takeaways

- Truth and love are inseparable in faithful leadership.
- How truth is spoken matters as much as what is said.

## Closing Thought

Today I will speak truth with love, not cruelty.
