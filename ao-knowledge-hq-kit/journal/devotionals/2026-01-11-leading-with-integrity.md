## Scripture

**Psalm 78:72**

## Reflection

Integrity is the alignment between belief, word, and action. Scripture connects effective leadership not merely to skill, but to integrity of heart. When integrity weakens, trust erodes quietly, often long before results begin to suffer.

Servant leadership depends on integrity because service requires credibility. Leaders who lead with integrity create stability even in uncertainty, because people know what to expect and where they stand.

Integrity does not mean perfection. It means consistency rooted in honesty.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on where your actions may be drifting from your stated values.
- Address one small inconsistency today with intentional alignment.
- Lead transparently, even when it feels uncomfortable.

## Takeaways

- Integrity stabilizes leadership influence.
- Trust grows where consistency exists.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with integrity that earns trust.
