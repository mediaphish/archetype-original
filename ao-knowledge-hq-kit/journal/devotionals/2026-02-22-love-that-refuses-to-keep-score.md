## Scripture

**1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+13:4-7/

## Reflection

Scripture tells us that love "keeps no record of wrongs." Leadership culture, however, often operates on subtle scorekeeping. Who delivered. Who failed. Who owes. Who deserves.

Love-led leadership refuses that ledger.

Keeping score may feel justified, especially after repeated mistakes. But it quietly shifts leadership from restoration to resentment. When leaders track offenses instead of growth, relationships become transactional.

This does not mean ignoring patterns of behavior or avoiding accountability. It means refusing to let past failures become permanent labels. Love addresses what is broken without preserving it as ammunition.

Relational faithfulness grows here. Love remembers grace more than grievance.

## Practical Application

- Notice where you may be mentally tracking past offenses.
- Address patterns directly instead of storing resentment.
- Release one grievance you've been quietly holding.

## Takeaways

- Love refuses to keep relational score.
- Grace restores what resentment hardens.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead without keeping score.
