## Scripture

**Luke 16:10 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Luke+16:10/

## Reflection

Leadership culture often celebrates bursts of intensity—big pushes, bold moves, and visible effort. Scripture emphasizes something less dramatic but far more sustaining: consistency. Faithfulness practiced over time shapes character more deeply than short-lived intensity.

Servant leaders understand that steady presence matters. People are formed not by occasional moments of inspiration, but by reliable leadership that shows up day after day. Consistency builds credibility because it creates predictability, safety, and trust.

Long-term leadership health depends more on rhythm than force.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on whether your leadership tends toward bursts or rhythms.
- Identify one small habit that needs consistency rather than intensity.
- Commit to showing up steadily today.

## Takeaways

- Consistency builds trust.
- Sustainable leadership values rhythm over force.

## Closing Thought

Today I choose consistency over intensity.
