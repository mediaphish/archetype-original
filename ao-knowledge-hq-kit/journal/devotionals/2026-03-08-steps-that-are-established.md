## Scripture

**Psalm 37:23–24 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Psalm+37:23-24/

## Reflection

Scripture declares that the steps of a person are established by the Lord when He delights in their way. Leadership often feels uncertain because outcomes are not fully visible. Yet Scripture shifts the focus from outcomes to direction.

Established steps do not mean flawless movement. The passage acknowledges that a leader may fall. What steadiness promises is not the absence of missteps, but the presence of support. The Lord upholds the one who stumbles.

Leaders who believe every mistake defines them will hesitate constantly. Leaders who trust that their steps are upheld will continue forward with grounded confidence. Stability grows from trust, not perfection.

When leaders accept that God establishes their steps, they move with conviction rather than anxiety. They understand that forward motion does not require total control over results.

Steadfastness comes from knowing you are upheld even when you wobble.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on where fear of failure is shaping your decisions.
- Trust that missteps do not equal collapse.
- Continue forward with steady confidence.

## Takeaways

- Established steps reduce fear.
- God upholds imperfect leaders.

## Closing Thought

Today I will walk steadily, trusting that my steps are upheld.
