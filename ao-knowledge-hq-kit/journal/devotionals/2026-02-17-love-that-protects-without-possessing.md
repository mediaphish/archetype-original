## Scripture

**1 Corinthians 13:4–5 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+13:4-5/

## Reflection

Leadership love includes protection—but Scripture draws a clear line between protecting and possessing. Love does not control, manipulate, or cling. It creates safety without ownership.

Leaders who cross this line often believe they are caring well, when in reality they are holding too tightly. Possessive leadership restricts growth. Protective leadership creates space for maturity.

Scripture describes love as patient and kind, not self-seeking. That posture matters. Leaders who love faithfully guard people from harm without treating them as property or extensions of their own identity.

Relational faithfulness grows here. Love protects people while still honoring their agency.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on where protection may have turned into control.
- Release unnecessary oversight that limits growth.
- Trust others with responsibility instead of holding it tightly.

## Takeaways

- Love protects without possessing.
- Healthy leadership honors autonomy.

## Closing Thought

Today I will protect without controlling.
