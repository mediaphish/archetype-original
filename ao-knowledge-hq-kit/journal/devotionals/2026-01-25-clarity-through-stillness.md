## Scripture

**Psalm 46:10 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Psalm+46:10/

## Reflection

Leadership noise is constant. Decisions, opinions, urgency, and expectations compete for attention. Scripture invites leaders into a different posture—not withdrawal from responsibility, but stillness that restores clarity.

Stillness is not inactivity. It is intentional pause that allows perspective to recalibrate. Leaders who never slow down often confuse motion with progress and reaction with discernment. Over time, this erodes judgment and increases anxiety.

Servant leaders value stillness because it sharpens vision. In quiet moments, distractions lose their authority and what truly matters comes back into focus.

## Practical Application

- Identify one moment today to intentionally pause without distraction.
- Resist the urge to fill silence with activity or noise.
- Allow stillness to clarify your next decision.

## Takeaways

- Stillness restores perspective.
- Clarity grows when leaders slow down.

## Closing Thought

Today I choose stillness so I can lead with clarity.
