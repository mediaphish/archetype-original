## Scripture

**James 5:7–8**

## Reflection

Growth rarely follows the timelines leaders prefer. Scripture uses the image of a farmer—patient, attentive, and dependent on processes that cannot be rushed. Leadership growth works the same way.

Servant leadership requires patience with people, systems, and oneself. Pressuring growth often produces surface-level compliance rather than deep development. Patience communicates belief in the long-term value of people and the process required for maturity.

Leaders who cultivate patience resist forcing outcomes prematurely. They understand that lasting growth takes time, care, and trust.

## Practical Application

- Identify an area where you’ve been tempted to rush progress.
- Ask what patience might look like in that situation.
- Commit to supporting growth rather than forcing results.

## Takeaways

- Sustainable growth requires patience.
- Rushed leadership produces shallow outcomes.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead patiently, trusting the process of growth.
