## Scripture

**Joshua 1:9**

## Reflection

Leadership often requires forward movement before confidence catches up. Scripture does not deny fear; it acknowledges it while calling leaders to courage grounded in presence and purpose. Courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to act responsibly despite it.

Servant leadership demonstrates courage through obedience rather than bravado. Leaders move forward thoughtfully, resisting both paralysis and recklessness, trusting God’s presence when outcomes remain uncertain.

New seasons often require courage not to retreat into what feels safe.

## Practical Application

- Identify a leadership step you’ve been avoiding out of fear.
- Clarify the responsible next action rather than the full outcome.
- Move forward with courage rooted in trust.

## Takeaways

- Courage grows through faithful action.
- Obedience often precedes confidence.

## Closing Thought

Today I move forward with courage, trusting God’s presence.
