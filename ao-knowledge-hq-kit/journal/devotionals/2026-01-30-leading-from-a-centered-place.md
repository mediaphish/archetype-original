## Scripture

**Isaiah 26:3 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Isaiah+26:3/

## Reflection

Leadership pressure can pull people off center. Urgency, conflict, and expectation often fragment attention and distort judgment. Scripture points leaders toward a centered posture—one rooted in trust rather than reactivity.

Leaders who operate from a centered place respond thoughtfully instead of impulsively. They are less driven by anxiety and more guided by conviction. This stability does not remove difficulty, but it changes how difficulty is carried.

Servant leadership flows more clearly when leaders are anchored internally.

## Practical Application

- Notice what currently disrupts your focus or peace.
- Identify one practice that helps re-center you.
- Choose to respond rather than react today.

## Takeaways

- Centered leaders respond wisely.
- Stability strengthens leadership presence.

## Closing Thought

Today I lead from a centered and steady place.
