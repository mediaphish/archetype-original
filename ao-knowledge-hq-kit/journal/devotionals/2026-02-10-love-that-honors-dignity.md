**Romans 12:10 (ESV)**

## Reflection

Love in leadership begins with how leaders see people. Scripture calls leaders to honor others—not selectively, not strategically, but genuinely. Honor is not flattery. It is the disciplined choice to recognize dignity regardless of role, output, or agreement.

When leaders fail to honor dignity, relationships quietly erode. People feel reduced to function rather than valued as individuals. But when leaders lead with love that honors dignity, trust deepens. People are more willing to engage, contribute, and grow because they know they are seen as more than a means to an end.

Honoring dignity does not mean avoiding authority or truth. It means exercising both without diminishing the worth of others. Love holds authority with care. It corrects, directs, and decides without stripping respect.

Relational faithfulness shows up here. Love refuses to trade dignity for efficiency.
