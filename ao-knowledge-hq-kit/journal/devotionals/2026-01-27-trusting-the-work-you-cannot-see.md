## Scripture

**Galatians 6:9 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Galatians+6:9/

## Reflection

Leadership often demands patience with unseen progress. Effort does not always produce immediate results, and faithfulness can feel unnoticed. Scripture encourages leaders to persist without losing heart, even when outcomes are delayed.

Servant leaders learn to trust the work happening beneath the surface—growth in people, alignment in culture, and maturity in themselves. Discouragement often arises when leaders measure progress too narrowly or too quickly.

Consistency over time reveals fruit that urgency cannot produce.

## Practical Application

- Identify an area where progress feels slow or invisible.
- Recommit to faithful effort rather than immediate results.
- Encourage someone else who may be growing quietly.

## Takeaways

- Growth often happens out of sight.
- Faithfulness sustains leadership through delay.

## Closing Thought

Today I trust the work being done, even when I cannot see it.
