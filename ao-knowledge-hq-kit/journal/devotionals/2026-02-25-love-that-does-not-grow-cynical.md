## Scripture

**Galatians 6:9 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Galatians+6:9/

## Reflection

Leadership carried over time can harden the heart. Repeated disappointments, unmet expectations, and strained relationships create fertile ground for cynicism. Scripture speaks directly into that weariness. Do not grow weary in doing good.

Cynicism often feels protective. It shields leaders from hope, vulnerability, and future disappointment. But it also quietly erodes love. When cynicism settles in, leaders begin expecting the worst rather than cultivating the best.

Galatians calls leaders back to endurance—not naive optimism, but steady goodness. Love refuses to withdraw simply because the work is difficult. It continues to sow what is right, trusting that fruit may come later.

Relational faithfulness deepens here. Love perseveres without becoming bitter.

## Practical Application

- Notice where disappointment may be shaping your expectations.
- Replace cynical assumptions with patient endurance.
- Continue doing good even when results feel delayed.

## Takeaways

- Cynicism erodes love over time.
- Endurance protects the heart from bitterness.

## Closing Thought

Today I will choose perseverance over cynicism.
