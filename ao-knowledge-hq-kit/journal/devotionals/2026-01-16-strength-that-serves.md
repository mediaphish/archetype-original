## Scripture

**James 4:6**  
https://www.esv.org/James+4:6/

## Reflection

Strength is often misunderstood in leadership. Many assume that strength is demonstrated through certainty, dominance, or control. Scripture reframes strength by pairing it with humility. God’s opposition is not directed at strength itself, but at strength detached from awareness and restraint.

For servant leaders, humility is not a loss of authority—it is the discipline that keeps authority from becoming destructive. Leaders who refuse humility often confuse confidence with infallibility, creating distance instead of trust. Strength that serves, however, remains open to correction, grounded in reality, and attentive to the people it impacts.

This kind of strength does not demand attention. It earns trust. It protects rather than intimidates. It creates environments where people can grow without fear.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on where your strength may be drifting toward control instead of service.
- Invite feedback from someone who experiences your leadership directly.
- Use your influence today to protect, support, or elevate someone else.

## Takeaways

- Humility directs strength toward service.
- Controlled strength builds trust and credibility.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with strength that serves, not strength that demands.
