## Scripture

**Isaiah 26:3**

---

## Reflection

Isaiah does not describe peace as something leaders manufacture through discipline or control. Peace is something God keeps when a person's mind is steadfast—fixed, anchored, and oriented toward Him.

For leaders, this reframes the source of stability. Leadership pressure often tempts us to scan endlessly for outcomes, approval, or threats. Scripture points instead to a different posture: a mind set intentionally on God rather than consumed by circumstance.

Servant leadership flows more faithfully when leaders are not centered on themselves, but anchored in trust. Stability is not found in managing everything well—it is found in trusting the One who holds everything together.

## Practical Application

- Notice what your attention has been fixed on lately.
- Identify where trust has been replaced by control or anxiety.
- Reorient your focus toward God before making decisions today.

---

## Takeaways

- Peace is kept by God, not produced by leaders.
- A steadfast mind shapes faithful leadership.

## Closing Thought

Today I fix my mind on God and trust Him to keep me steady.
