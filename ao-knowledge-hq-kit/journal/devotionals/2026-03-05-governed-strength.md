## Scripture

**2 Timothy 1:7 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/2+Timothy+1:7/

## Reflection

Scripture reminds us that God gives not a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.

Leadership often feels like pressure to project strength. Scripture reframes strength as governed power.

Power without love becomes harsh. Love without self-control becomes unstable. Self-control without courage becomes passive. Steadfast leadership holds all three together.

Strength that is governed produces calm authority. It is confident without being volatile.

## Practical Application

- Examine where fear may be influencing your leadership posture.
- Choose governed strength instead of reactive force.
- Lead with power shaped by love and discipline.

## Takeaways

- Godly strength is governed strength.
- Balanced authority builds trust.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with power shaped by love and self-control.
