## Scripture

**Ecclesiastes 7:8–9 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Ecclesiastes+7:8-9/

## Reflection

Renewal reshapes how leaders relate to time. Impatience often masquerades as urgency, pushing leaders to accelerate processes that require care. Scripture reminds leaders that the end is not the only measure of faithfulness—the process matters deeply.

Servant leadership requires renewed patience because growth rarely follows clean timelines. Leaders who rush development often undermine the very outcomes they seek. Renewal slows the leader’s internal clock, allowing people, culture, and decisions to mature rather than fracture under pressure.

Patience is not inactivity. It is renewed trust that faithful consistency produces stronger foundations than forced momentum.

## Practical Application

- Reflect on where impatience may be driving your leadership.
- Identify one area where you need to slow down rather than speed up.
- Choose steady faithfulness over quick results today.

## Takeaways

- Renewal reframes how leaders relate to time.
- Patience protects long-term health.

## Closing Thought

Today I renew my leadership by honoring the process.
