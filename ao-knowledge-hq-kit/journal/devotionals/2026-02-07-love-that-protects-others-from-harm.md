## Scripture

**John 10:11–13 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/John+10:11-13/

## Reflection

Leadership love is not passive or detached. Scripture presents love as protective, watchful, and willing to stand between people and harm. When leaders love well, they do not retreat when situations become difficult or costly. They remain present, alert, and committed to the well-being of those entrusted to them.

Protective leadership love does not seek control. It seeks safety, growth, and stability for others. This often requires leaders to absorb pressure, confront threats, or make unpopular decisions so others are not exposed to unnecessary harm.

When leaders fail to protect, trust erodes quickly. But when leaders willingly carry the weight of protection, people experience security that allows them to grow and contribute fully.

Relational faithfulness shows itself clearly here. Love does not abandon responsibility when danger approaches.

## Practical Application

- Identify where your leadership carries a protective responsibility.
- Choose presence over avoidance when challenges arise.
- Act in ways that prioritize people over convenience.

## Takeaways

- Love protects others even at personal cost.
- Faithful leadership creates safety for growth.

## Closing Thought

Today I will lead with love that protects those entrusted to me.
