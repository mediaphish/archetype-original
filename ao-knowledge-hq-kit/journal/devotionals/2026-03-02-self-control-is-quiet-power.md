## Scripture

**Proverbs 25:28 (ESV)**  
https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+25:28/

## Reflection

Scripture compares a person without self-control to a city broken into and left without walls. Leadership without self-control leaves everyone exposed.

Influence magnifies temperament. An uncontrolled leader creates instability. A disciplined leader creates security.

Self-control is not emotional suppression. It is emotional governance. It is the ability to feel fully without reacting impulsively.

Steadfast leadership is built on this quiet power. Walls are not built through aggression, but through discipline.

## Practical Application

- Identify one emotional trigger that regularly disrupts your steadiness.
- Pause before responding in your next tense moment.
- Choose discipline over impulse.

## Takeaways

- Self-control protects what leadership builds.
- Emotional governance strengthens authority.

## Closing Thought

Today I will exercise quiet power through self-control.
