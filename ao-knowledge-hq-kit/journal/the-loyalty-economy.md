# The Loyalty Economy

Every organization has a culture of loyalty. The real question is:  
What, exactly, are people expected to be loyal to?

Healthy teams are loyal to the mission, the values, and to one another.  
Unhealthy teams are loyal to one thing: the leader’s ego.

You can feel the difference quickly.

In a healthy culture, people can disagree without being punished. Feedback is welcomed. Bad news arrives on time. Loyalty looks like honesty, courage, and shared responsibility.

In a narcissistic culture, loyalty looks very different.  
Loyalty means praise.  
Loyalty means silence.  
Loyalty means absorbing impact instead of naming it.

And slowly, the organization stops functioning like a team and starts functioning like an economy—where the primary currency is devotion to the person in charge.

In small businesses, this shows up when people start saying things like, “You know how they are—just keep them happy,” as if regulating the leader’s emotions is part of their job description. In larger organizations, it hides inside politics, alliances, and protective circles around power.

The outcome is the same: truth gets taxed, and loyalty gets rewarded.

Psychology has language for this. Social identity theory and research on abusive supervision show that insecure leaders often build in-groups and out-groups to maintain control. The in-group gets access, protection, and influence—as long as they don’t threaten the leader’s image. The out-group gets distance, blame, and eventual removal.

Sometimes it shows up in a single sentence—a sentence that tells you everything you need to know about the health of the environment:

“If you’re not for me, you’re against me.”

That mindset has no place in leadership.  
There are no separate teams in a business.  
There is only one team: the one everyone is already on together.

Any attempt to split people into sides defeats the purpose of the organization before it ever has a chance to move in the same direction. When loyalty becomes personal instead of shared, unity becomes impossible.

In these environments, the unwritten rules become obvious:

The people who ask hard questions stop getting invited to key meetings.  
The ones who nod along get more opportunity.  
The person who raised a legitimate concern becomes “not a culture fit.”  
Decisions are made in private huddles and handed down as final truth.

Soon, everyone understands the real currency of the organization:

Stay close.  
Stay agreeable.  
Stay useful.  
Or slowly disappear.

Narcissistic leaders lean into this because it protects them from exposure. If loyalty is measured by agreement, disagreement can always be dismissed as disloyalty. If only the “faithful” are trusted, only affirming voices are allowed near the real story.

From the outside, it looks like unity.  
Inside, it's quiet fear.

People stop sharing what they see. They edit their words. They cushion their feedback. They build backchannel conversations because they can’t say the truth in the room. High performers either comply, detach, or eventually walk away.

Research on psychological safety is clear: teams cannot do their best work when they’re constantly calculating whether telling the truth will cost them. When leaders treat honest input as threat, they train people to survive instead of contribute.

Servant leaders build an entirely different loyalty system.

They don’t want loyalty to them personally. They want loyalty to the work, the values, and the mission. They welcome strong opinions, even when those opinions complicate their decisions. They make room for disagreement without making it a betrayal.

In these cultures, the most trusted voices aren’t the ones who flatter the leader.  
They’re the ones who help the leader see clearly.

That shift changes everything.

Instead of asking, “Who’s on my side?” servant leaders ask, “Who’s helping us do what’s right?” They honor the people who protect the mission—even when it means pushing back. They don’t divide the team to protect themselves; they unify the team to protect the work.

And when challenge comes—which it always does—the difference becomes unmistakable.

In an ego-driven loyalty economy, people scatter.  
In a mission-driven culture, people strengthen each other.

One collapses under pressure.  
The other grows through it.

Leaders who demand personal loyalty are telling you about their fear.  
Leaders who cultivate principled loyalty—loyalty to what’s right—are telling you about their strength.

Over time, people learn what really matters by watching what gets rewarded.  
If flattery gets access, they’ll bring flattery.  
If honesty gets respect, they’ll bring honesty.

Every leader builds a loyalty economy.  
The only question is what kind of loyalty you’re actually teaching people to bring.
