## Key Themes and Messaging

### What ALI Is (from main ALI page)
- ALI is a leadership diagnostic built to help leaders see the conditions they are creating — long before drift becomes damage
- Leadership becomes measurable, visible, and directional
- The Archetype Leadership Index (ALI) is a leadership condition diagnostic designed for small and mid-sized organizations
- ALI measures the environment leadership creates (not feelings, not personality, not engagement)
- Focuses on clarity, trust, communication, consistency, safety, and emotional tone
- ALI is a mirror - shows leaders how their leadership is being experienced based on impact, not intent

### Target Company Size
Based on the application form, the pilot program targets:
- 10-25 employees
- 26-50 employees
- 51-100 employees
- 101-250 employees

### Pilot Program Characteristics
- Described as an "early-stage research project"
- Requires initial conversation/fit assessment ("Let's talk about where you are, what you're trying to build, and whether ALI is the right fit")
- Personal follow-up within 48 hours after application
- Structured onboarding: "I'll be in touch within 48 hours to set up our first conversation and get you started"

## Notes for Landing Page Content Generation

When creating content for the `/ali` landing page, consider:

1. **Pilot Program Positioning**: The pilot is positioned as an early-stage research project, not a fully commercialized product
2. **Target Audience**: Small to mid-sized organizations (10-250 employees)
3. **Process**: Application → 48-hour follow-up → Initial conversation to assess fit
4. **Value Proposition**: ALI helps leaders see leadership conditions before drift becomes damage
5. **Differentiation**: ALI measures conditions (environment), not feelings, personality, or engagement
6. **Tone**: Conversational and relationship-focused ("Let's talk about...")

## Content Gaps to Address

Consider including in the landing page:
- What happens after the initial conversation?
- What are the expectations/commitments for pilot participants?
- What are the benefits of participating in the pilot?
- How long is the pilot program?
- What data or insights will participants receive?
- Is there any cost associated with the pilot?
