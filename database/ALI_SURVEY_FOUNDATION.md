# ALI Survey Foundation: What We're Testing

## The Core Question ALI Answers
**"Is the leadership you think you're providing the leadership your people actually experience?"**

## The 7 Leadership Patterns (Categories) ALI Measures

These are the **seven arenas** that every survey question maps to. All questions test one or more of these patterns:

### 1. **Clarity**
**"Do people understand what matters most?"**

What we test:
- Whether leaders define expectations clearly
- Whether priorities are communicated effectively
- Whether decisions are explained
- Whether direction actually lands with the team
- Whether clarity is maintained under pressure
- Whether drift is corrected quickly
- Whether people are protected from ambiguity

**Key signals:**
- Strong clarity → faster cycles, lower friction, fewer resets
- Weak clarity → hesitation, rework, conflict, confusion

---

### 2. **Consistency**
**"Do leaders show up the same way every time?"**

What we test:
- Whether leaders behave consistently
- Whether standards are enforced consistently
- Whether responses are consistent
- Whether emotional regulation is consistent
- Whether follow-through is consistent
- Whether behavior matches intention under pressure

**Key signals:**
- Strong consistency → credibility, stability, predictability
- Weak consistency → culture instability, distrust, leader drift

---

### 3. **Trust**
**"Is this a place where people can speak honestly?"**

What we test:
- Psychological safety
- Fairness across the team
- Openness and transparency
- Stable reactions to mistakes
- Space for disagreement
- Freedom from retaliation or fear
- Confidence in leaders under pressure

**Key signals:**
- Strong trust → candor, early escalation, safety
- Weak trust → silence, fear, late resignations

---

### 4. **Communication**
**"Does information flow, or does it get stuck?"**

What we test:
- Whether messages actually land (not just whether leaders talk)
- Decision bottlenecks
- Message distortion
- Looping conversations
- Unclear expectations
- Fear-based silence
- Information hoarding
- "Leadership by assumption"

**Key signals:**
- Strong communication → autonomy, short meetings, aligned teams
- Weak communication → confusion, repeated questions, assumptions

---

### 5. **Alignment**
**"Do team behavior and leader intention match?"**

What we test:
- Whether leaders and teams interpret values the same way
- Whether behavior matches cultural expectations
- Whether teams understand what "good" looks like
- Whether people are rowing in the same direction
- Whether the organization is drifting

**Key signals:**
- Strong alignment → shared understanding, unified action
- Weak alignment → drift, misalignment, confusion

---

### 6. **Stability**
**"Does the environment feel safe, steady, and predictable?"**

What we test:
- Emotional steadiness
- Psychological structure
- Pressure management
- Conflict handling
- Role stability
- Expectation stability
- Predictability under pressure

**Key signals:**
- Strong stability → performance, confidence, resilience
- Weak stability → chaos, fear, performance collapse

---

### 7. **Leadership Drift**
**"Are small behavior changes slowly creating big cultural consequences?"**

What we test:
- Whether leaders stop communicating clearly
- Whether conflict is avoided
- Whether ambiguity is allowed to grow
- Whether leaders become reactive
- Whether standards change subtly
- Whether accountability is reduced
- Whether leaders overcorrect under pressure
- Whether inconsistent patterns emerge

**Key signals:**
- Strong drift detection → early warning, course correction
- Weak drift detection → silent decay, cultural breakdown

## How Survey Questions Are Structured

### Question Architecture (from Part II)

**1. Multi-angle phrasing**
Each core concept is measured from different angles:
- One positive phrasing
- One negative phrasing
- One experiential phrasing
- One observational phrasing

If all four align → the pattern is strong. If they diverge → something meaningful is happening beneath the surface.

**2. Quarterly 10-question cadence**
- Four surveys per year
- 10 questions each
- Three questions overlap every quarter (for trajectory tracking)
- The rest shift to reveal new signals
- Patterns emerge fast — long before cultural decay does

**3. No revealing which questions are "about what"**
- Questions stand alone
- Weights are invisible
- Patterns are emergent
- Prevents bias and gaming

**4. No personality or preference scoring**
- ALI isn't about who someone is
- It's about how leadership is experienced
- Avoids shame, ego, or defensiveness
- Focuses on behavior and alignment, not identity

## The Three Core Lenses (How Questions Are Evaluated)

### 1. Behavioral Alignment
**"Does what leaders intend match what teams experience?"**

Signals tested:
- Consistency
- Fairness
- Emotional steadiness
- Follow-through
- Clarity of direction
- Clarity of expectations
- Reliability under pressure
- Reactive vs. responsive patterns

### 2. Trust Density
**"How stable, predictable, and psychologically safe is the environment?"**

Signals tested:
- Safety to speak honestly
- Safety to disagree
- Safety under mistakes
- Predictable leadership behavior
- Fairness across the team
- Clarity and transparency
- Freedom from retaliation or fear
- Confidence in leaders under pressure

### 3. Communication & Clarity Patterns
**"Do people understand what leaders think they've communicated?"**

Signals tested:
- How well expectations are understood
- Whether roles are crisp or blurred
- Whether decisions loop or land
- How quickly clarity breaks under stress
- Whether the team feels aligned or confused
- Whether information flows or gets jammed
- Whether leaders are communicating or offloading

## The Four Scores ALI Produces

### 1. Alignment Score
The gap between intention and experience
- Compares leadership intention to lived experience
- Reveals alignment, drift, blind spots, disconnects, strengths, early-warning signals

### 2. Stability Score
How predictable, steady, and safe the culture feels
- Surfaces hidden fear, unspoken tension, emotional volatility
- Measures inconsistent leadership signals, role confusion, trust fractures

### 3. Clarity Score
How well the team understands direction, priorities, roles, and expectations
- Measures expectation alignment, role clarity, communication effectiveness
- Tracks decision-making flow, information accessibility

### 4. Trajectory Score
Whether culture is improving, alignment is tightening, trust is building
- Driven by quarterly patterns, overlapping questions, multi-angle phrasing
- Shows trend detection and signal consistency

## What Survey Questions Must Test

Every question must measure one or more of the 7 patterns through the 3 lenses:

**Questions should reveal:**
- Where leadership is aligned
- Where it's drifting
- Where it's unclear
- Where it's creating unnecessary friction
- Where trust is strong
- Where fear is hiding
- Where expectations are crisp
- Where they are not
- Where communication is breaking down
- Where the team's lived reality diverges from the leader's intent

**Questions should NOT:**
- Reveal which category they're testing
- Test personality traits
- Test preferences
- Create shame or defensiveness
- Be obviously "about" a specific pattern

## Key Principles for Survey Design

1. **Measure behavior, not personality**
2. **Test experience, not intention**
3. **Use multi-angle phrasing** (positive, negative, experiential, observational)
4. **Keep questions standalone** (don't reveal what they're measuring)
5. **Focus on patterns, not moments**
6. **Enable trajectory tracking** (overlapping questions across quarters)
7. **Reduce bias and fear** (anonymous, no judgment, no personality profiling)

## Summary

**The 7 Arenas:**
1. Clarity
2. Consistency
3. Trust
4. Communication
5. Alignment

**What we're testing:**
- Behavioral alignment (intention vs. experience)
- Trust density (psychological safety, predictability)
- Communication & clarity patterns (message landing, information flow)

**How questions work:**
- 10 questions per survey
- 4 surveys per year
- 3 questions overlap quarterly (for trajectory)
- Multi-angle phrasing (4 angles per concept)
- No revealing what's being tested
- No personality profiling
